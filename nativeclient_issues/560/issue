(http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/source/detail?r=2358),
NaClAppThreadDtor() must now be called from the thread that is
shutting down, because NaClSignalStackUnregister() must be called from
the same thread where the signal stack was registered.

If NaClAppThreadDtor() were called from the wrong thread and this
unregistered that thread's signal stack, it would be dangerous if that
thread is later used to run untrusted code, because signal frames
would get pushed onto the untrusted stack.

NaClAppThreadDtor() is currently used safely, I believe, but there are
some internal interfaces that should be changed to help ensure that it
continues to be used safely.

NaClAppThreadDecRef(), and the concept of thread ref counts, should be
removed.  The only call site for this (other than
NaClSysCommonThreadSuicide()) is NaClAppDtor().

NaClAppDtor() is basically unused: there should be no situation in
which it really shuts down threads, because this is not something it
is able to do safely.  There is a TODO in sel_ldr.h for
NaClAppDtor()'s removal.

NaClAppDtor() is called in web_worker_stub.c, which appears to be dead
code and hence untestable.  To remove NaClAppDtor(), we'd need to
break or remove web_worker_stub.c.
