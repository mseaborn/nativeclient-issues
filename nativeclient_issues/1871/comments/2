Real fix will have to be in native_client source, and probably done by someone with more TCB experience (there are already related TODOs in there for bsy, sehr, and mseaborn). However this bug can be worked around by explicitly #including &lt;sys/time.h&gt; after &lt;time.h&gt; in the user program (as demonstrated in tests/nanosleep/nanosleep_test.c). Everyone cc'd on this bug but me probably already knows that. Maybe this post will benefit some future searcher.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-05-31T17:45:10.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-05-31T17:45:10.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 2 by dsch...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1871#c2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1871/comments/full/2" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
