Putting two toolchains (DragonEgg and Clang) together would just increase the mess and would not make any guarantee about ABI compatibility, because ABI would be implicitly defined (and the tool above is to make the ABI explicit, to allow third-party PNaCl toolchains, for example, for other languages which would like to target to PNaCl).

Also, if we have two separate toolchains, there're no problems to put them near each other, build tests using different toolchain for different source files, link them together and run. Having such a test suite would be nice, but it's less important than an explicit PNaCl bitcode ABI definition and separating things (to make the overall system simpler).</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-09-26T21:00:14.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-09-26T21:00:14.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 18 by krasin@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2279#c18" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2279/comments/full/18" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
