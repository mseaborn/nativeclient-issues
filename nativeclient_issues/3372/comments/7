- It is currently origin-private because HTML5 tempfs is so. We may want to start it out as origin-private and do a more thorough security review, but I could imagine it using a shared per-profile directory in the future.


- I think we do want to stop this from filling up the disk.  I'm not sure how cache size policies are normally determined, especially with a bunch of different separate cache instances in chrome now.  The other options would also have sizing issues.  Perhaps we could pick an arbitrary limit for now, like MIN(1GB, 15% of free disk).  The largest NaCl executable from when I last looked was 100MB (uncompressed).


- Ok, I was just worried that in the future the tempfs would clear more often (e.g., when you reboot, as /tmp would).  Perhaps there are enough web apps that use html5 tempfs for cache that the implementation wouldn't switch to clearing that often.


- The other thing I want to be clear about is that we want to use something like ppb_file_io_trusted's GetOSFileDescriptor with files from this.


Also responded to some of the comments in the doc.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2013-04-23T17:39:56.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2013-04-23T17:39:56.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 7 by jvo...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3372#c7" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/3372/comments/full/7" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
