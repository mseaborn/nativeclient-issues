Reaping should probably be automatic, ala the net cache, although reaping an mmaped file needs to be dealt with gracefully.  If would be nice if writes to this cache were only done by trusted code and metadata could be associated with each file so that validation could be "baked in" after translation (and regenerated if a validation assumption has changed).  Having a cache where we could bake in validation would also help us solve some problems we are having with stubout in the non-pnacl case.

I don't think that's saying anything that's not already understood, but I thought I should make my interests explicit.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2013-04-23T17:57:20.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2013-04-23T17:57:20.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 9 by ncb...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3372#c9" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/3372/comments/full/9" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
