It seems likely that the problem is somewhere in the ANGLE shader translator. Unfortunately trying to narrow down where the problem is, even with this test case, is a very large job. I dumped the shaders for this sample before and after translation and the resulting file is over 7000 lines long. Not a pleasant task to try to track down the issue, especially given that we can't easily make modifications to the shaders and see the effects. Additionally, it is not (that) easy to sidestep the ANGLE shader translator in Chrome since the input shaders are GLSL ES and we are running on top of OpenGL. Although it might be  be able to wedge in a simple processor which just deletes precision qualifiers, this is still a chunk of work.

Sorry, but I am decommitting myself from this bug to indicate that further work is needed by the submitter, since it looks like the ExternalDependency status isn't supported in NaCl's issue tracker. Please reduce the test case further. It might be possible to continue to make progress with the test case as is, but there are other issues demanding attention and this one will be very hard to narrow down without further help.
