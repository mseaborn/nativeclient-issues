The USENIX paper talks about BIC versus TST but doesn't quote numbers:
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/native_client/data/site/NaCl_SFI.pdf

I think it'll be CPU-dependent anyways. All I'm talking about is disabling it for now since we don't generate it, but I definitely think we should use TST at some later time.

Can we disable high-resolution timers? Will there be apps that want them? That'll just increase the iterations they need for their loop though, it probably won't prevent an attacker from defeating ASLR on a 32-bit system.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-10-30T16:20:34.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-10-30T16:20:34.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 3 by j...@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3117#c3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/3117/comments/full/3" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
