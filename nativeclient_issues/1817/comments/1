I also found that some recent chrome 13 builds are flaky wrt to NativeClient.

Alex helped me get up to speed on being able to step through chrome processes in the Chrome / NaCl processes.
What I found with my recent sync of chrome that I built on Windows is ... that chrome rev 85894 (13.0.771.0) works.
I can run chrome with --enable-nacl-debug --no-sandbox and then load the nexes built with top-of-tree NaClSDK.
The sel_ldr process hangs, but unlike what Mike and I saw last week, port 4014 gets opened.
I then ran 
   rsp_proxy (an exe Mike L created for Windows) that forwards the 4014 port from the loopback interface
and started gdb on linux and connect to &lt;MyWindowsIp&gt;:4014 and it works.

Doing some digging, I found that my existing chrome 13  (13.0.767.1-85531 dev-m) does not work properly on Windows,
and Matt verified that on his Windows box.  It says it loads the nexe, but the buttons never work.

The version I built does load nexe and the debug stub works (85894 - 13.0.771.0 ) and this 
version (downloaded rather than built) also works: 13.0.770.0 - 85880.



For the SDK used the 'head' of the nacl_sdk tree (not the 0.3 release) but the very latest SDK (rev 863) with the updates Matt and others had checked in for Chrome 13 (src= instead of nacl=).</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-05-19T21:45:22.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-05-19T21:45:22.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates>
