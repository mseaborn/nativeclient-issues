I investigated issue further and found out that it is not as bad as I
previously think.

The system timer always saves and restores gs. The problem is that
syscalls entrance and syscall exit routines neither save nor load gs.
In both cases gs is not overwritten with zero in the kernel.

Windows kernel, on other hand, zeros gs if it switches context to a
thread in another process and does nothing if it switches context to a
thread in the same process.

So this scenarious can occur:
1. A thread with non-zero gs makes syscall. Windows decides to switch
control to a thread in another process and then switch it back. gs
became zero at the exit of the syscall.
2. A thread with zero gs make a syscall. Windows decides to switch
control to a thread in the same process with non zero gs. This thread
works some time and then is interrupted by timer. Windows decides to
switch control back to the first thread. The threads are in the same
process so Windows does not set gs to zero. The first thread exits
syscall with non zero gs.

The only problem is the second scenario because our untrusted threads
can't make syscalls. We can't prevent second scenario and so we
shouldn't store trusted gs. I will prepare CL that fixes this shortly.
