There have been several manifestations with different projects (libraries).  We have not found any errors in our Gyp files to account for this.  Brad's current opinion is that this represents an issue with Gyp/VS.  So I don't think we have a way to fix this.  I have no idea why Chrome doesn't see this all the time on their own projects.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-05-27T00:12:49.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-05-27T00:12:49.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 3 by noelal...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1807#c3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1807/comments/full/3" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
