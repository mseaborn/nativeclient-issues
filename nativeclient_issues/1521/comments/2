Update: still happens w/ svn rev 5605.

(*) Only the linker script ever gets truncated.
(*) Doing fetching the linker script thousands of times before or after client-side-translation has occurred, will NEVER fail. Normally the problem is reproduced in less than 20 tries. The original timing of the fetch really matters.
(*) The linker script is always truncated by the same amount, from 9133 bytes to 3895 bytes.
(*) Truncation happens when the "Pnacl Coordinator" is implemented within the plugin (see http://codereview.chromium.org/7109018/) or as a JS script. I.e., it doesn't matter if you are using StreamAsFile vs UrlAsNaClDesc.
(*) Truncation has already occurred when the file was stream-as-file'd. If you fstat() within FileDownloader::GetPOSIXFileDescriptor(), you will notice that the downloaded temp file is only 3895 bytes. I.e., this is before the file is ever touched by PNaCl's linker nexe.
(*) HTTP headers correctly say "Content-Length: 9133", even when the file is truncated.
(*) Debug vs Opt of sel_ldr and/or the NaCl plugin does not matter, thank goodness...


Okay, probably no point in trying to solve this, since the production version
should not require downloading the linker script. This only makes the current
test for the current prototype really flaky.
