&gt; it is present from the current directory. Is this correct behavior?

Yes and no.  We need ld to find linker scripts via the library path
(or at least some search path) so that we can override them
transparently when we need the dynamic-linking versions.  The fact
that the search path apparently includes the current directory is not
so good.

&gt; We're building our own version of binutils from our own
&gt; repository. Since it does not yet include this change, it is
&gt; generating the old version of the ldscript, and placing it in
&gt; ldscript/elf_nacl.x.

The fact that PNaCl has made another branch of binutils is not great.
I'd suggest you fix this by applying my patch to remove CEILP2 and
NACL_MASK.  Later it would be good to unfork the binutils changes.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-02-23T21:22:00.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-02-23T21:22:00.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 5 by mseaborn@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1469#c5" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1469/comments/full/5" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
