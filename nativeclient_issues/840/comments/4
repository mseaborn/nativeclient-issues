The problem with spurious defines are easily seen from fallout: they trigger linux-specific code. Often this code is Ok, but just as often it's not. If the developer decides to fix the problem in particular package by adding -D__linux__ - it's his decision, but we don't want to pretend NaCl is linux. Because it's clearly not.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-08-23T11:07:09.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-08-23T11:07:09.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 4 by k...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=840#c4" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/840/comments/full/4" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
