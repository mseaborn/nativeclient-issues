For the 64-bit validator there are no differencse according to vdiff, so hopefully we will similarly see clean more mostly-clean results for these tests in terms of the top-level result of whether a sequence is valid or invalid.

For the 32-bit validator, there are a significant number of differences. Although we haven't categorized them all yet (64-bit work is higher priority) we know that some of them are due to ideosyncratic behavior of the prod validator that we don't want to imitate in R-DFA. I suspect some of these same differences will be reflected in the hex tests. Both for the hex tests and for vdiff we ultimately need to understand all differences and confirm they are safe. It would be worth having a tracking tag/issue for each implementation difference, such that each testing difference could be tagged when it has been understood. As I mentioned we have not categorized all the 32-bit differences but Victor will be able to recite quite a few of them.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-09-20T13:33:48.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-09-20T13:33:48.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates>
