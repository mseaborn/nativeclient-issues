Furthermore, the machine that was not exhibiting the problem was running a 32-bit kernel, and switching it to using a 64-bit kernel caused the problem to occur.  Both Macs are running the same version of OS X, 10.6.7 (10J869).

So this confirms that the 64-bit kernel is responsible.

Macs from the last few years are all capable of running 64-bit kernels, but only very recent Macs run the 64-bit kernel by default.  Mac OS X apparently picks the default kernel type based on the machine's model.  Specifically:

"These Macs use the 64-bit kernel by default in Mac OS X v10.6.
    * Mac Pro (Mid 2010)
    * MacBook Pro (Early 2011)"
(from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3770)

It is possible to identify the model programmatically by running "system_profiler" from the command line.  (The same info is also accessible via "About This Mac" -&gt; "More Info".)  I have tried this on two machines:
"MacPro4,1" - defaults to 32-bit kernel
"MacPro5,1" - defaults to 64-bit kernel
(more info attached)
