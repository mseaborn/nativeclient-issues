Also we had a bad toolchain rev in which strip would inflate the size of binaries (pad it) to match a bogus alignment constraint.

The 600k was from the size of the windows full release installer after 7zip compression (which is what they care about as its the cost over the wire).

They track install size quite a bit, and this going in caused a spike. One your back in town (and the fixed strip has bubble thru the release pipeline), we should sit down with the release folks and see if this is acceptable.

Their main concern was that it not get too much bigger.
