			<ns0:name>mseaborn@chromium.org</ns0:name><ns0:uri>/u/mseaborn@chromium.org/</ns0:uri></ns0:author><ns0:content type="html">Currently, sel_ldr is set to expire after a date that is fixed into the 
source code.  After this date, it stops working.  This is very unfriendly to 
developers.  It means that we do not have reproducible builds.  A test that 
passed one day can fail the next day, without warning.

Suppose you are debugging a NaCl program, and you want to check whether a 
problem has been caused by a recent change to NaCl.  The expiry date 
frustrates this, because testing against an older sel_ldr will fail.

The expiration check should be removed from sel_ldr.

As a compromise, an expiry check could be put into the Firefox plugin 
instead, since this is the only mechanism that will download code from the 
Web that doesn't have an auto-update mechanism.  However, expiring the 
Firefox plugin has similar problems, though to a lesser degree.  It is harder 
to do automated testing of the Firefox plugin, but not impossible, since our 
Scons build does it -- and so expiry of the plugin would break the full Scons 
build.
