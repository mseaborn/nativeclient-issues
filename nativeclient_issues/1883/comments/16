Sorry for the slowness!  I have the posted patch which Roland and others have reviewed.  I was going to take Roland's feedback and post a new patch for a /dev/anonshm device that will provide remappable pages.  I will try to do it early next week, but if you have some time, here's the starter patch with Roland's feedback at the end:

   http://gerrit.chromium.org/gerrit/#change,2341

I don't think there is really much work -- especially if we start with VM_NORESERVE then look into more advanced change after we've sent it upstream for feedback.  (We need it at least in process before we'll land it in the CrOS kernel -- even if it turns out only we end up using it/keeping it for NaCL).

Thanks!</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-06-24T16:33:16.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-06-24T16:33:16.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 16 by wad@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1883#c16" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1883/comments/full/16" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
