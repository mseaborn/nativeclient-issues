The other solutions were not amenable to upstream through pre-lkml discussions.  I don't believe talking to Puneet is going to make this happen sooner, but feel free to try.  One of the two tested CLs will land in CrOS if rezero doesn't have any upstream promise, then we can pursue a better fix that is much more likely to be acceptable to other distros that have similar security goals.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-08-08T17:44:59.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-08-08T17:44:59.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 21 by wad@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1883#c21" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1883/comments/full/21" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
