This pass would mark known symbols as internal. So in the above, the problem with _Unwind_* will be solved, as well as main, exit and _exit.

However, this would not solve the problem of functions that exist for the sake of intrinsics. If we internalize those, pnacl-translate won't be able to find them when lowering intrinsics on the target machine. So if we don't want them exposed in the pexe, we may have native versions of them pnacl-translate could find.
