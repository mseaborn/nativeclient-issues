we are being more picky about headers than about other things that would present a
similar problem.

For example, it looks like you are concerned that an nexe might somehow get access to
those headers, even if they are not being loaded. A valid concern, since bugs may
exist and one may cause us to load more than we need. On the other hand, we don't
check for example that the PT_LOAD headers cover all of the file, do we? A bad nexe
can hide as much data from us by just not putting it in any segment.

The same in true for any other tools, and as mark pointed out, the verifier rejecting
a nexe will not prevent another tool from looking at it.

So, the general statements are correct, but I think we should look at the particular
issue. There are a lot more checks that we could do just to be more picky about the
ELF objects, but they don't add enough value to justify the complexity. This might be
such a case. The issues it has caused

*) Having to special case PT_TLS (a very small issue, that is true)
*) Mark having to hack the loader to fit the verifier view of what ELF looks like.
*) I haven't done a "svn blame", but I suspect that part of the reason why the code
was convoluted was because it was trying to do more than it needed. Granted, it is
possible to have a simpler implementation that does the same, but to be more picky
you will always need more code in the TCB.
*) Anyone trying to build a new toolchain for NaCl will likely hit these problems again.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-06-04T13:33:09.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-06-04T13:33:09.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 7 by espind...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=558#c7" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/558/comments/full/7" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
