Please explain what useful data people will want to have in other nonPT_LOAD segments 
that must be present in a load image.  And what segment types will be used.  I find 
the discussion lacking in detail. With vulnerabilities we cannot know the bugs since 
otherwise we'd fix them but with useful data its surely feasible to name these 
segment types.

also, an addendum:

i am getting the feeling that many of you think that the whitelisting gets in your 
way.  and that it is inflexible.  the notion is not that the whitelist, once written, 
never changes.  rather, the rationale behind using a whitelist is that every addition 
is considered, hopefully carefully, for security/functionality/etc trade-offs.  in 
contrast, the default ignore policy being promulgated, would allow us to never look 
at this issue again, because essentially anything goes after it's implemented.  
furthermore, once implemented, it is also very difficult to retract, since the horse 
is out the barn door, so to speak.

as for victor's notion that it reduces overall security, i think that argument has as 
its basis the inflexibility of the whitelist.  khim:  please correct me if i am mis-
stating it.  since we are open source and are -- hopefully -- responsive to potential 
toolchain authors, i don't see this as a valid assumption:  if there are valid 
reasons to add to the whitelist, i don't see why we wouldn't comply.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-06-05T17:31:47.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-06-05T17:31:47.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 13 by b...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=558#c13" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/558/comments/full/13" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
