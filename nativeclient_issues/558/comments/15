something like .gnu_debuglink section), information for incremental linker (or link 
to information to said incremental linker), non-standard defines (for laguages like 
Pascal or Ada) and so on.

The idea that people will ask us to extend this table is so funny I don't even know 
what to say about it: 9 out of 10 developers will not even think to ask us about this 
list and will hack around. They will only ask about limitations if they can't hack 
something working from what's they have on hands. Heck, if our own developers first 
idea was to introduce some kind of workaround then how can we even hope Joe Average 
will do anything else?

Any list included in Chrome build can as well be cast in stone: people tend to assume 
platform they are using is fixed and can not be changed by "mere mortals". Even if 
they'll see message "this list is just includes elemetns we know about, feel free to 
bug us for extension" they assume it's debug message left around in release build by 
mistake and directed to core developers only!
