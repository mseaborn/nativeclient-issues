should be reviewed by david or myself, and this is an opinion of yours that should 
have been discussed.  you are not always right.

the philosophy that we adhere to is to whitelist rather than to blacklist.  this is a 
standard security design principle.

the basic idea is that it is better to be restrictive, to only allow things that we 
recognize -- and know how to check for validity -- than to only reject things that we 
recognize as bad, since anything that is "uncertain" would be rejected.  we control 
the toolchain, and our toolchain should never generate anything that the service 
runtime would reject.  greater "flexibility" only gives attacker more wriggle room.  
for example, even though the service runtime doesn't load unrecognized segments into 
untrusted memory, those segments may end up being processed by other tools (e.g., 
dynamic loaders, debuggers, performance analysis tools, etc), and encouraging the 
addition of extra program segments only gives attackers a larger attack surface on 
which to play.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-06-04T05:26:49.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-06-04T05:26:49.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates>
