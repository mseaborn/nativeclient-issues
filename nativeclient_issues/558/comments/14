&gt; that must be present in a load image.  And what segment types will be used.

Part of the argument for allowing any non-load segment is that we can't
know it all. I have found usefulness in PT_TLS. Mark has found in others.
The same thing may pass to other developers.

&gt; as for victor's notion that it reduces overall security, i think that argument has as
&gt; its basis the inflexibility of the whitelist.

A bit maybe, but the first reaction of a developer hitting this is probably
going to be the same I had with gold: assume there is a good reason
why we cannot allow segment PT_XYZ and try to hack it in the tool. I
was lucky in that Ian's review to my patch to gold was basically "why do you
need this"?

Maybe we should at least point out in a comment next to the table (and maybe
in the error message) that we are just using a whitelist as tight as we
can for the current known users?
