x11-2.0.so with which exactly the same file name i find in my computer(/usr/lib). But 
another problem happened. It says -lXt option can't be found for ld when linkding 
libnpGoogleNaclPlugin.so. But libXt is also there in /usr/lib. I have tried to set 
LIB_PATH in SConscript under ../nacl/googleclient/native_client/npaip_plugin, but 
failed. Just for a try, i comment the libXt and finally it compiles.

But it doesn't say ok. I find i can run example in shell like earth with run.py. But 
when i came to firefox. It just show a blank frame. I think maybe i shouldn't replace 
libgtk-x11-2.0.so with mine and omit libXt. Maybe google has modified some of it.

The problem with firefox also appears when i use the prebuilt version.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2009-03-23T03:34:36.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2009-03-23T03:34:36.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 6 by vincent....@gmail.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=61#c6" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/61/comments/full/6" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
