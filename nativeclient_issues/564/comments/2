will be useful in the future.
I primarily see this as a way to detect error early, similar to linux
keeping  statically linked linux 2.6 binaries from being run on earlier kernels.

Syscall renumbering is probably not good enough because somebody could try
to run newer nexes with older service runtimes and get weird results.

As far as the mechanism is concerned, an .ABI-note section seem like the right thing to do. I presume this is what Linux uses.

BTW: We have not defined what the ABI entails yet.
There is probably agreement on system call numbers and signatures being part of the ABI. Certain aspects of the address space organization will have to go in as well.
