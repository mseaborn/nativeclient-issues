It runs the same build &amp; test as the "hardy64-glibc" toolchain
Buildbot.  Specifically, it builds both the newlib- and glibc-based
toolchains, and it runs the Scons tests on the glibc-based toolchain.
However, it does an incremental build, so it will only rebuild
binutils, gcc, newlib, glibc etc. if their dependencies change.  So in
most cases it should be quick to respond (10 minutes for a build
currently).  However, if many people pass different "-r" values to
"gcl try", it may have more work to do and take longer to catch up (45
minutes per rebuild currently).

So please look out for results from "nacl-modular-toolchain" in the
trybot e-mails, and don't ignore failures from it without
investigating.  If the trybot gives you incomprehensible results or is
often slow to respond, please let me know.

Now that there is a trybot for this, any change that breaks the
nacl-glibc Buildbot is likely to close the tree or be reverted! :-)
