Noel doesn't have it. I get asked what kind of problems we have with GYP, and [surprise!] I don't have much credibility without citing details.

I am going to look into working around the bug, factoring the build steps in the gyp file as per Noel's suggestion. Even if we eventually get a work-around I'd still like the GYP bug identified someplace in our written history, and make sure it is being prioritized appropriately.
