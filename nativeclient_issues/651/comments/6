I was disappointed to find that my comments on this issue before had led to the startup code being forked between the PNaCl build (crt1_x86_{32,64}.S) and non-PNaCl build (the yuckier crt1_x86.S), which I hadn't expected.

My only concern originally was with the proposed change to add nacl_startup.o to nacl-gcc's spec file (http://codereview.chromium.org/2812032/show).  At the time, nacl-glibc wasn't tested on the buildbots/trybots and would have been broken by this change without forewarning.

However, there's no reason to put nacl_startup.o into the spec file.  It can just be put into libcrt_platform, which is already in the spec file.  nacl-glibc already has a workaround to supply an empty libcrt_platform.

The magic libsrpc/libav initialisation code has all gone away now, so is not relevant any more.
