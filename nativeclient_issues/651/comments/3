			<ns0:name>mseaborn@chromium.org</ns0:name><ns0:uri>/u/mseaborn@chromium.org/</ns0:uri></ns0:author><ns0:content type="html">There are two problems with crt1_x86.S:

1) It does in assembly what could easily be done in C.  Robert
addressed this by writing some of it in C.

2) It does magic libsrpc and libav initialisation before main() gets
called.

I think (2) is somewhat weird and unnecessarily NaCl-specific, and it
is not going to live on in nacl-glibc.  (See issue 617.)

If you want to fix (1) without addressing (2), it is doable: you can
statically link nacl_startup.o into crt1.o, then you won't have to
change any spec file.  But it does not buy you anything -- the
nacl-gcc toolchain has no pressing need to reduce assembly code -- so
I wouldn't bother.

So basically, I agree.
