If this isn't up and running by release, the test should be run manually and/or temporarily re-enabled on the bots when we're stable for M14.  (If there are no big changes going on, this test won't cause any problems.)

This is currently on my "spare cycles" list, but the more I think about it I may want to bump it up in my priorities.  Getting reload / surfaway coverage on the integration bots would add another layer of safety for the release.

Resolving this issue will require knowledge of PyAuto, bot changes, and script changes.  Off the top of my head, Noel and Nicholas may have some of the puzzle pieces already.  Possibly Jan.  If no one has picked this up by Friday, I will.
