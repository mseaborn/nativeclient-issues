First, we are either burning power and wasting time loading the DLL, or we are burning power and wasting time going through two proxies instead of one when we do use it.  Second, power use is a more about number of bits flipped then about time.

So as we move forward and NEXEs become more prevalent our energy saving solution of going OOP can end up costing more, or even much more especially if NEXEs trend towards long running pages with lots of RPCs.

In any case, I don't have numbers for PPAPI RPCs per DLL load or their respective computation (energy) cost so I do not have a quick answer for this by M14.  

Alternatively, we can just make some assumptions that for the short term, faster start is a win for whatever reason power or otherwise, in which case we should replace this with issue, with feature request to go OOP which I won't get to by M14.
