starting with the first integration CL, and the conclusion was always the same: files 
from the chrome directory should not be included outside of that directory. So a 
policy does exist. Do you think there are any benefits in changing that policy?
As for register functions, we already have one such function: 
RegisterInternalNaClPlugin in src/trusted/plugin/nacl_entry_points.cc. We can 
probably enhance it to use the mechanism you suggest in (b), if we don't hit any 
design problems in the process.
By the way, the Windows sandbox is pretty separate from Chrome and can be found in 
the sandbox directory. Unfortunately, it seems that the situation for Linux and Mac 
is different.
