There are no discussion about policy because there are nothing to discuss. Native 
Client is supposed to be web-technology, not Chrome-technology. Implementable by 
Chrome, Firefox, or even MS IE (if Microsoft will decide to support it). Thus Chrome 
dependency is a defect. It's Ok to have Chrome dependency in optional parts of Native 
Client - for example if Native Client will provide additional facilities to Chrome 
extension writers this part can depend on Chrome. But core part of Native Client MUST 
NOT depend on Chrome.

The rest of discussion is correct - we need to decide how Native Client API will 
evolve when it's not tied so tightly to Chrome and when changes to API can stretch 
over years, not days.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-05-14T11:39:41.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-05-14T11:39:41.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 3 by k...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=469#c3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/469/comments/full/3" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
