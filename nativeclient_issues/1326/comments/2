I used the same revision of Chrome we had in native_client/DEPS - 71089.
My native_client was synced to revision 4146. In the same client,  I svn-updated papi/example/2d is synced to revision 71231 to get the latest fix.

I built the partial sdk and then all nexes.
I navigated to http://localhost:5103/scons-out/nacl-x86-64/staging/examples_ppapi.html

Here are the issues I observed:

With --enable-nacl (nacl is pulled in at 4085):
- SRPC "Shared Memory API" - fails with a pop-up "Memory Maps test setup failed", all tests are blue (not run)
  -- passed with --register-pepper-plugins
- SRPC "Resource Descriptor Transfer" - 4/6 tests are red (failed)
  -- only 1/6 failed with --register-pepper-plugins
  -- later this was verified to be fixed with --register-pepper-plugins
- PPAPI "Scripting" - 2 red (failed) "integer" tests
  -- same with --register-pepper-plugins
  -- later this was verified to be fixed with --register-pepper-plugins
- PPAPI "Audio" - no sound
  -- passed with --register-pepper-plugins
- PPAPI "2D" - does not turn blue
  -- passed with --register-pepper-plugins
- PPAPI "Url loading" - times out
  -- expected with this version as the support was checked after 4085
  -- if time out is caused by absence of "loadUrl" method, this is caused by a scripting bug tracked separately</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-01-19T19:03:45.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-01-19T19:03:45.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 2 by pol...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1326#c2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1326/comments/full/2" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
