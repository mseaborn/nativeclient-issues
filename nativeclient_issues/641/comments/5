			<ns0:name>mseaborn@chromium.org</ns0:name><ns0:uri>/u/mseaborn@chromium.org/</ns0:uri></ns0:author><ns0:content type="html">The problem is that there is a cycle between two objects:

obj1 = PluginNpapi instance (IS-A Plugin IS-A PortableHandle)
       (this is not refcounted)
       scriptable_handle_ field points to obj2

obj2 = ScriptableImplNpapi instance (IS-A ScriptableHandle, IS-A NPObject)
       (this is refcounted by virtue of being an NPObject)
       handle_ field points to obj1

Solving this by refcounting both objects would not help because it
would create a refcounted cycle and thus leak.

We could resolve this by not reusing the ScriptableImplNpapi wrapper
object every time NPP_GetValueNPP/VpluginScriptableNPObject is called.
But then we will have multiple wrappers with different identities in
Javascript (assuming the browser does not cache this value).

Alternatively, we could resolve this by making the two objects the
same, so that we do not have separate PortableHandle and
ScriptableHandle objects.
