Would it make sense for the plugin to tell the browser to evaluate the JS attached to the "onload" attribute at the end of it's initialization?  I need to understand the loading process better, but it seems that once the plugin knows that its .nexe has been loaded and is running, then it can trigger the "onload" event.  I *think* that if the onload JS is called from the Plugin's ScriptableObject (or whatever that turns into), then |this| in JS will point o the right thing.  Does that make sense?</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-10-09T13:26:11.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-10-09T13:26:11.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 7 by dsprin...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=693#c7" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/693/comments/full/7" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
