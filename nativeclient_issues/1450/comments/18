Could this just be a version skew issue?  Is the gallery supposed to be compatible with 12?  (SDK folks?)

Until NaCl is officially released, old nexes will likely break when Chrome has a major-numbered release.  We're working hard to achieve backwards compatibility, but we aren't there, yet. 


If you want to dig deeper, you can enter these snippets of code in the Javacript console for the life example (hello world is slightly different, the embed tag will have a different ID):

document.getElementById('life_view').readyState    (4 is good)
document.getElementById('life_view').lastError   ('' is good)

I think these attributes are supported in 12, but if they aren't check .__moduleReady  
 instead (1 is good, 0 is a load error, undefined means NaCL is disabled?)

There may be output already in the Javascript console, such as "bad elf magic number".  I got that message for the hello world example in Chrome 12.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-06-20T19:36:59.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-06-20T19:36:59.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 18 by ncb...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1450#c18" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1450/comments/full/18" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
