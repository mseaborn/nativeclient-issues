The status is that we have not stabilised a bitcode ABI for PNaCl yet and there is no ABI checker in the codebase yet.

&gt; If there is a such kind of checker, I am just wondering why it
&gt; should be enforced by the PNaCl translator instead of doing it at
&gt; the very first stage.

We don't want to be in a situation where pexes work one day but break the next day following a browser update.

If by "first stage" you mean the user toolchain, that would mean that adhering to the ABI would only be voluntary.  People could produce pexes that don't follow the ABI but might still work in the browser, but that might break in a later version of the browser.
