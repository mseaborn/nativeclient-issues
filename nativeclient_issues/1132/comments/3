From our mailing thread discussing the first attempt to switch the build, here is the list of blockers as they were 2 months ago:

1. Git commit id tracking for reproducing the build - the discussion on this was not finalized

2. modular-build will break

3. Support for multiple git repos (&gt;2) was considered something frightening

4. Git was unstable on windows

5. We didn't want to make significant changes because of the important milestone being close;


OK, let's review these:

1. Is a technical question that has a solution. Probably PNaCl experience can help;

2. Nothing changed here after 2 months. However, we can build everything needed at the moment with the Makefile. I insist on *not* considering modular build issues as blockers;

3. This seems change to the opposite. Now the advocated idea is to have separate git repo for each component, thus we'll have at least 4 (binutils,gcc,newlib,glibc);

4. Don't know if something changed. Does anybody know? Otherwise I'll try to find out;

5. Nothing changed here - we are always close to our next next milestone. Does it mean we never do significant changes? I hope no.

To summarize, I don't see any actual blockers except 4.
