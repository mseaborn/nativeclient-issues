I'll make a note to update it, though it will hopefully be superseded by documentation for VSX plugin before Baltic Brill.  We do have debug_stub support in sel_ldr now and we're (mlinck, mmortensen) updating the Visual Studio plugin to prepare it for release.

OOP work (garianov) is in progress but we don't anticipate it being ready in time for Baltic.  We have windows OOP debugger getting close to production-ready but linux is still a rough prototype and mac prototype is still in progress.  Once there are 3 working prototypes, we'll need to design a standard mechanism for runtime to provide debugging info to all of them, before they actually become finalized.

Linux debugging stories shouldn't change too much until we're ready to roll out eclipse support which is still a ways off. 

IRT impact cannot really be measured yet.  We're working on figuring out why IRT enabled version of native_client won't work with SDK.  Mball is making progress on that.  Once we have that we can assess impact on debugging and reorganize debugging related stories in our tracker (https://tracker.corp.google.com/projects/3867) accordingly.  We'll need to figure out whether debug_stub still works, whether there are regressions caused in the client, whether OOP debuggers need to be modified, whether docs need to be tweaked, etc..

Normally, we don't use blanket tickets like this because they're not useful for organizing work flow, so with your understanding, we'll leave this ticket open for a while if there's a need to discuss the plan here, but eventually mark it won't-fix once interested parties have been caught up on "the plan."  If anyone needs read access to the SDK tracker, I'll be happy to add you.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-05-17T15:42:59.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-05-17T15:42:59.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 1 by mli...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1809#c1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1809/comments/full/1" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
