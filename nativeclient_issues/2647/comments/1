If there are interfaces to get this sort of information from the browser, I don't know about them.

newlib has very limited support for the locale interfaces.  glibc has very thorough support.  Both depend on access to locale data files.  We don't supply the built data files in our toolchains, though we could at some point in the future.

For the support to work given those data files, you need to make file access work via something like nacl-mounts, and then have all those data files available via some mechanism nacl-mounts supports, e.g. in the application package or downloaded on the fly from some URL.

It's unrealistic to get all the machinery in place very quickly.  Moreover, it's not at all clear what the support model really ought to be for browser-based applications.  It's probably more appropriate for i18n support to be done via browser-level mechanisms rather than inside the nexe itself.  But that remains to be hashed out, and needs a lot of thought.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-03-08T18:07:40.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-03-08T18:07:40.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 1 by mcgra...@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2647#c1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2647/comments/full/1" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
