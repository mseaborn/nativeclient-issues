We have 3 things [.so, .a, .nexe] where each of these can be bitcode or not, and see which cases have linking problems.  If it's only a problem with [bitcode, bitcode ,bitcode] vs [not-bitcode, bitcode, bitcode] then that's good (in that there's only one problem case).</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-05-24T16:28:17.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-05-24T16:28:17.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 1 by jvo...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2807#c1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2807/comments/full/1" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
