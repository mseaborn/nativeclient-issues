&gt; We don't use MAP_FIXED this way, so the bug you are anticipating is
&gt; not there.  We use mmap() with a preferred address (the first
&gt; argument), and if the returned address differs, we undo the mapping
&gt; and return an error.  See nacl_dyncode_alloc.c.  One of the points of
&gt; this issue is that we could retry with a different address.

how many retries would be needed?  without better controls over address space use, then this may require probes with different preferred starting addresses for every 64k, with at least two syscalls per probe.  so, it sounds like it's more a potential performance issue, and programmer usability issue (tiny bits of new code, suddenly no space for any dlopens) once we decide post-startup dlopens should be better supported.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-11-01T18:18:23.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-11-01T18:18:23.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 12 by b...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1082#c12" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1082/comments/full/12" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
