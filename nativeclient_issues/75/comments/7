this appears to be more a documentation error than anything else.  as noted
elsewhere, the whitelist is temporary, since we intended NaCl modules to be loadable
from anywhere.  the intent of the whitelist is to protect researchers from
inadvertently loading a NaCl module while we are still getting the (low hanging) bugs
out.  the whitelist actually prevents the EMBED or OBJECT tag from having any effect
unless they appear in HTML that's sourced from a trusted source.  so if a researcher
trusts a machine that directs them to load NaCl modules from a bad source, then the
trust is misplaced -- the module could have been placed onto the whitelisted server
too.  this is an issue in the face of XSS, since clearly an XSS attack on a trusted
web server could be mounted to cause the researcher to load NaCl modules from a
untrustworthy place.  of course, a trusted web site that has XSS vulnerabilities
wasn't really trustworthy to begin with, but that's a bit of a digression.

anyway, i agree that preventing module loading based on the module's origin is
probably better for testing, since the whitelist is compiled in and then we wouldn't
have to worry about XSS issues.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2009-05-07T00:18:50.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2009-05-07T00:18:50.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 7 by b...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=75#c7" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/75/comments/full/7" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
