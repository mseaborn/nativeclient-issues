That's the only place web page errors occur.  If they don't know to look there, we need to train them to do so.

In addition to ensuring that all errors show up in the console, the other thing we should do is to continue to expose more error detail via javascript events (we've done some on this front and have a few other bugs filed as well).  That way a developer can handle and report errors in as much detail as they'd like with as much UI as they'd like.  Again, this is the standard web development model.

I think this one should be WontFix and if there are specific errors that aren't being reported to the console or JS today, we should file specific bugs for each.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-08-31T21:08:48.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-08-31T21:08:48.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates>
