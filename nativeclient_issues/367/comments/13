marking as accepted, but since this is pretty open ended and i cannot guarantee that there is any realistic time for completion.  i intend to futz with using the fault injection code to add tests that ensure more errors are properly reported, but will eventually context switch to something else as the low(er) hanging fruits are plucked, at which point i'll mark it as available.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-09-02T22:57:00.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-09-02T22:57:00.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates>
