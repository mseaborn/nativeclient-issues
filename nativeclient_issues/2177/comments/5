That made me install the wrong version to begin with, but I didn't notice it, you name all the files the same name (googlechrome.dmg) - even the beta.
I tried to get this sample running: http://goo.gl/y15pz
I followed all the steps, but it was version 13 - so it didn't work.
Then I looked was version I have, saw it was 13, tried to re-download from the beta page, saw that the file name is googlechrome.dmg, decided that you have a bug in your site, found this site: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/32956/google-chrome and this file: http://www.macupdate.com/download/39816/GoogleChrome.dmg for the beta, installed it over version 13, NaCl samples still didn't work, I deleted this directory: "/Users/User/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome", now it worked after I enabled NaCl in the about:flags (with the command line options and the env var)</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-08-23T19:04:09.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-08-23T19:04:09.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 5 by assafRa...@gmail.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2177#c5" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2177/comments/full/5" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
