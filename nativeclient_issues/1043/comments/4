the check and warnings messages should certainly never be removed, since as cbiffle correctly pointed out, the stack alignment is a requirement of the ABI.  having the check is a useful feature of the TCB -- it detects a bug in the untrusted runtime.

i think it might be reasonable to make the thread creation syscall fail, rather than aborting the process, but i lean in the direction of LOG_FATAL aborting, since this is a pretty basic ABI issue, and programmers who are linking against buggy thread libraries probably should get stronger / more immediate feedback.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-10-15T17:50:39.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-10-15T17:50:39.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 4 by b...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1043#c4" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1043/comments/full/4" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
