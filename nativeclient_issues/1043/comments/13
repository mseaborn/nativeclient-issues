thread_create(): Remove forcible stack alignment and verbose warning

We have now have test cases to check for this instead, in
tests/stack_alignment.

nacl-glibc does the stack alignment in the child thread, because the
simplest way to align the stack is by putting
"__attribute__ ((force_align_arg_pointer))" on the child thread
function.  This avoids the need to use architecture-specific code to
do this.  (The alignment rule would be different for x86-32 and
x86-64.)  Linux glibc also aligns the stack in the child thread
(in clone.S).

Doing the alignment in the child thread meant that sel_ldr was
producing a warning, which was superfluous given that glibc was
behaving correctly.  We increase the verbosity level at which a
warning is printed.

Stack alignment is a calling convention that is internal to the guest
code, and it's not really sel_ldr's responsibility to enforce this.
An ABI might choose not to maintain this as an invariant, and instead
align the stack only in functions where it is needed (e.g. for SSE),
as the existence of "force_align_arg_pointer" demonstrates.
