1. The new URLLoader mechanism is asynchronous, and yields control back to the browser as soon as it initiates the URL load.
2. The test used a JS timer to poll the .nexe, testing for the presence of a __moduleReady property.

As soon as the NaCl plugin returned after issuing the URL load request, the browser immediately asked the plugin for its __moduleReady property, which is present in the trusted plugin.  Thinking that the .nexe was loaded (when it wasn't), the test continued on, trying to call functions on the trusted plugin that do not exist, hence the failure.

The fix is to use the onload event handler of the &lt;embed&gt; tag, and delay starting the tests until the event fires.

We need to have some other tests for the onfail handler (see also bug http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1147)</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-11-09T03:01:14.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-11-09T03:01:14.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 1 by dsprin...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1146#c1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1146/comments/full/1" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
