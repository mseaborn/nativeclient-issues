&gt; https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/nativeclient-mirror/nacl/nacl_sdk/trunk.169649/naclsdk_linux.tar.bz2
&gt; and it is not available anymore.

Generally, snapshots are not supposed to disappear from commondatastorage.googleapis.com, and if they do, we want to fix that.

Ben Smith's reply is:  "Apologies for all this: I was performing some cleanup of our directory structure and moved some files that I believed were not being used (by looking through old manifest files and moving bundles that were not published).

"This bundle is not removed, just moved: The link is now http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/nativeclient-mirror/nacl/nacl_sdk/unused/trunk.169649/naclsdk_linux.tar.bz2

"In general, our bundle naming scheme should be clearer about published vs. continuous builds, but it currently isn't. :-/
I've filed a bug to do this here: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=223644"</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2013-03-25T18:53:52.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2013-03-25T18:53:52.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 12 by mseaborn@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3347#c12" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/3347/comments/full/12" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
