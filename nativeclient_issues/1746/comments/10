What we have already prunes stuff away.  It only looked like there was more to prune because the pexe was built with -O0 and not -O3 during the link.  As long as you use -O3 during the link, stuff gets pruned and there is very little difference between using --gc-sections and not using it.  -std-link-opts only changes things slightly.
