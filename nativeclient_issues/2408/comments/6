Info on caching: for modern machines, the largest file cached will be 32 MB.  This doesn't seem to be the issue in this case, but if disk space or free memory is low the maximum size will be dialed back.  You could also be overflowing the total size of the cache - but again, this seems unlikely if there's sufficient space on your system.  Having multiple tabs open may result in multiple renderer processes which may split in memory cache which may (?) influence caching.

Try reloading the same page and see what happens?  On a side note, I've noticed the manifest file is sometimes not cached.  I've been meaning to look into this.

Try the flags: --disk-cache-dir="DIR" --disk-cache-size=BYTES to experiment and eliminate some of the variables?  Also, make sure you start with only one window/tab and see if you can reproduce the problem in this situation.

See what about:cache claims is in the cache?</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-11-02T03:08:54.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-11-02T03:08:54.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 6 by ncb...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2408#c6" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2408/comments/full/6" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
