unfortunately we have not tested on debian unstable.  we haven't
tested on debian stable either.  we don't currently have the resources
to support other linux distributions than ubuntu.  we have tested our
builds on dapper (the old LTS) and on hardy, and on a 64-bit hardy
system things work -- after running tools/linux.x86_64.prep.sh to fix
a few symlinks.  but ubuntu 64-bit user space systems support 32-bit
apps by having /usr/lib32 and /usr/lib64 for 32- and 64-bit libraries,
with 32- and 64-bit versions of ld.so knowing where to search for
shared library objects, and that's very different from a 32-bit
chroot.

that said, we'd welcome community input/support on getting NaCl to run
on other linux distros.  if you can give us patches (or other
suggestions) to getting our build environment working with other
distros, that would be wonderful.  NB: please do sign the open source
contributor's agreement, since otherwise we won't be able to take your
patches.
