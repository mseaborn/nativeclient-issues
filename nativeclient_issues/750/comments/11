That is why there is no way to mmap (reserve) 1Gb. Mapping flags don't matter in this particular case. sel_ldr as standalone program works on Chrome OS (it requires only few shared objects). To prove that it is address space fragmentation issue run ldd /opt/google/chrome/chrome on device and observe that there is no space for 1Gb continuous reservation.

As we discussed to solve this problem sel_ldr needs to be moved to separate binary.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-09-27T06:39:57.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-09-27T06:39:57.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates>
