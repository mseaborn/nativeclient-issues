The new problem that Ivan found on Chrome OS is tracked as issue 1883.

We're not sure what caused the address space fragmentation or what changed to make the problem go away.  In chrome_map.log, there is plenty of free address space, but it's not contiguous.  It had the following gaps between libraries:

gap: 50MB
gap: 48MB
gap: 73MB
gap: 666MB
gap: 163MB
gap: 118MB
gap: 170MB
gap: 326MB
gap: 79MB

Maybe this was caused by the kernel's mmap() allocation policy or by using prelink, although I can't find any evidence that Chrome OS has used prelink.
