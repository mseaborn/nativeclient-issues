This causes ld's sanity check to fail.

The sanity check is at fault: it should not care where .tbss is placed, because .tbss has no contents and its position is immaterial.  Its only significant attributes are its size and alignment.

A workaround is to reorder the sections in the linker script.  Putting a non-empty section such as .eh_frame after .tbss makes the error go away.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-01-07T12:02:12.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-01-07T12:02:12.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 1 by mseaborn@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1299#c1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1299/comments/full/1" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
