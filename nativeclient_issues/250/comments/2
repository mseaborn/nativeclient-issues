(possibly too rare) scenario where a user unsubscribes from our update process but 
leaves the binaries installed.  this is trivial in linux by removing 
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list, but might be harder for windows/osx where 
omaha is used.  leaving expiration in puts an additional burden on us to update even 
when there's no other software changes, and we should do the cost-benefits analysis 
wrt bandwidth, engineering costs, etc (apt doesn't do incremental update, though we 
should be able to organize the code so that the expiration is in a separate .so) 
versus the additional user protection that we can provide.  when users are altering 
their machine's configs, it's hard to make our protection fool proof....

as for the localhost restriction, we definitely should not remove until we have had 
our security code audits and after all p0 security bugs have been fixed.  it's a 
judgement call for p1 and lower bugs -- as is the assignments of the bugs' priority / 
criticality -- and we'll have to figure out the process.  we also need a way to set 
up the ability to (temporarily) make high priority security bugs unreadable to the 
public until they've been fixed, assuming that the security researchers are following 
responsible disclosure etc.  such issues in the issue tracker should become public 
after the fix has been live in the stable channel for a couple of days, so that most 
people will have picked up the fix, and should not remain hidden for much longer.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-01-20T19:06:40.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-01-20T19:06:40.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 2 by b...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=250#c2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/250/comments/full/2" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
