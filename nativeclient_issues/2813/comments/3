Anyway, in comparison to the usability of "--enable-pnacl" (which triggers the delay install) vs an actual extension, what's missing is:


- UI to trigger the install (if such UI is needed).  In comparison, people could go to the webstore and do the install.

- Progress of the install.  In comparison, the webstore install re-uses the download-progress-UI, showing the actual download of a CRX file.

- UI to show *when* the install is complete.  Conversely, show when it isn't there.  In comparison, the "about:extensions" page lists the extension.  Perhaps we could have "about:plugins" list this.

- UI to show what version is actually installed. (about:* page)

- If we want to do something like the Ivan's "wtf nacl" JS/HTML page, then it would be nice if JS could detect when it is or isn't available.


Some other ideas: this may be similar to the puzzle box that shows up when Flash or other plugins aren't available, assuming that the plugin's embed tag has a non-zero display area.
