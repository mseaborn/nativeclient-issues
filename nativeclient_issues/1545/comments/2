The issue with the windows version has to do with the use of VEH, with a possibly unsafe RSP.  At the point in which the exception handler starts processing, the OS has already written to RSP to store the exception context, so while both the current handler and the proposed patch both will exit in the case of an untrusted exception (except for when debugging is enabled) the damage has already been done in both cases.

The correct solution is to avoid using VEH in Windows.

Since validating that NaCl is processing exceptions correctly, instead of removing this code, I have disabled it by default.  In this way we can continue to use this code in testing, but it will not execute without specifying '-S' on the command-line in sel_main.c.
