Chromium copies the downloaded .nexe file into the temp directory as "XXXX.tmp".

While the page is open, the file is locked, and I cannot delete it (either with "rm" in Cygwin or "del" from the Windows command prompt).

If I kill the sel_ldr process, the file stays locked.  (This happens both with Chromium's built-in sel_ldr and the external sel_ldr.)

If I close the tab (keeping Chromium running by having another tab), the file is unlocked and can be deleted.

This suggests that PPAPI or the NaCl plugin is holding the file open.

If I close Chromium, the files disappear.  But of course, our test runner is killing Chromium rather than shutting it down gracefully, so Chromium does not get a chance to remove the files.

This problem appears to be specific to Windows file locking.  On Unix it's easy to unlink a file that's in use, and NaCl on Linux Chromium doesn't appear to leak files in /tmp.

Some possible fixes (aside from the workaround Nick committed):
 1) Stop keeping the nexe file open longer than necessary.  There may be a leak within the renderer process.  (Eventually, sel_ldr might mmap the nexe file though.)
 2) Put temporary files into the browser's profile directory rather than a global temp directory.  Then we can clean up more reliably.
