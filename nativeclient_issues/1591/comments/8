Other apps like scummvm, "big app", snes9x, gold, etc. have proper "internal" markers for most functions except for things like memset and _start.

(grep "define " test.pexe.ll | grep -v "define internal")


================

However, even with "internal" marked everywhere, there are still lots of symbols that could be gc'ed.

See http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1746.

A specific example is scummvm, which leaves this constructor "Sky::ConResource::ConResource(void*, unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned short, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned char, OSystem*, unsigned char*)", which is an alias:

@_ZN3Sky11ConResourceC1EPvjjttjhP7OSystemPh = alias internal void (%659*, i8*, i32, i32, i16, i16, i32, i8, %19*, i8*)* @9967

The aliased function @9967 is marked internal, but not referenced anywhere else, so probably could have been pruned.
