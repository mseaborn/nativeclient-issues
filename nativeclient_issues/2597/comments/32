validator_ragel: eliminate blah-flags.cc that was included twice

This is a refactoring/cleanup/readability change.  Including a file twice is not
a good style, but without doing so it is hard to declare fields in a struct and
at the same time generate code that uses them without repeating the names twice.

Replace named bit fields with std::set of strings.  The magic of definition for
"condrep" etc. goes away.

Some downsides:
1. increased memory footprint.  It should be fine for a generator script which
   could have been written in Python with even bigger performance/memory
   sacrifices.
2. less static checking (old version complained on misprints in flag names at
   compile time). New version would complain at runtime, it's fine since the run
   time is very small and deterministic.

As a side change removed conditional compilation in many places (maybe too many)
because it complicated reading in vim: it puzzles the internal bracket matcher
making it harder to understand function boundaries, also affects syntax
highlighting.  Code disabled with "#if 0" will be possible to revive from
revision history.
