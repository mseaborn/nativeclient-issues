Hardware always sets EIP to point after int3.

Windows-specific issue that seems related is mentioned by Wine developers. Possible starting points are here:
  http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2007-February/054014.html
and here:
  http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2007-February/054195.html
Mentioned test that reveals the issue is:
  http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/blob/HEAD:/dlls/ntdll/tests/exception.c

The summary as I've got it is as follows:

EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT is a special case. For EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT, CONTEXT that is given to VEH handler has EIP decremented by 1.

Here is why GDB does not care about this:

Under Windows, GDB uses Debug API to catch exceptions (obviously, GDB does not use SEH/VEH, simply because it is a separate process :)). Debug events, including exceptions, arrive via WaitForDebugEvent. The context for the exception is obtained via GetThreadContext(current_event.dwThreadId), thus EIP comes "right from hardware", namely pointing after int3, exactly as expected by GDB.

Conclusion:

The difference we are seeing at the moment is Windows-SEH/VEH-specific case. Other OSes do not suffer from it. Even for Windows this might not always be the case, in particular, we might want an out-of-process debug stub, that works via Debug API.

To keep most of the code OS-independent, the right fix seems to be to modify EIP back in the EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT VEH handler.
