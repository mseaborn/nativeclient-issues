  "Essentially, __clear_cache does the following (using a system call):
  * Clean the specified data cache range.
  * Invalidate the specified instruction cache range."

Here's what happens in the kernel:

* In arch/arm/kernel/traps.c, the __NR_cacheflush syscall calls do_cache_op()
* which calls flush_cache_user_range() (in arch/arm/include/asm/cacheflush.h)
* which calls __cpuc_coherent_user_range
* which calls coherent_user_range from a struct
* on ARMv7 that calls v7_coherent_user_range (in arch/arm/mm/cache-v7.S)

It's fairly clear that a single call to this is not intended to handle doubly-mapped pages like what NaCl uses:

/*
 *	v7_coherent_user_range(start,end)
 *
 *	Ensure that the I and D caches are coherent within specified
 *	region.  This is typically used when code has been written to
 *	a memory region, and will be executed.
...

It has two loops to do:

 USER(	mcr	p15, 0, r12, c7, c11, 1	)	@ clean D line to the point of unification
and
 USER(	mcr	p15, 0, r12, c7, c5, 1	)	@ invalidate I line

The fact that it uses USER() because these can fault probably explains why I got different behaviour when I forced pages to be mapped.

Those two MCRs are privileged operations, so we can't do the flush in userland.  For now we can just call cacheflush twice as Ivan suggests.
