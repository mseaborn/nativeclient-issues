for what it's worth, such a strategy will ensure that should those errors fail and the rest of the system is still stable, we can tell that appropriate error messages would get propagated to the right place.

if somebody has input on exactly how such failures-to-launch should be reported to the user, please add to this issue.  i'll plan on putting a message to the javascript console (if one isn't already showing up) until i hear otherwise.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-08-25T19:34:02.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-08-25T19:34:02.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 11 by b...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1851#c11" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1851/comments/full/11" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
