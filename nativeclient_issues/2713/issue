To run:
  - Unpack it.
  - cd test1_dir
  - NACL_ROOT=/path-to/native_client/ make all
  - This will first run the native gcc version which should PASS and then
    runs the pnacl version which will currently assert.



What it shows:
  - Copy relocations are not generated correctly, so the main executable doesn't get the initial value of a global exported by a .so.  Instead the main executable just sees &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; as the initial value.

  - The DT_NEEDED are injected at the very end, while they are normally listed in the order of the original commandline.  This throws off interpositioning.  That is, .so files are allowed to have multiple definitions of symbols, and the first one loaded at runtime (according to DT_NEEDED or LD_PRELOAD) is used.  The way it is now, the wrong symbol might interpose.

  - Externally exported TLS variables are marked local and in the .symtab instead of in the .dynsym.  This is probably bad.



It needs to be cleaned up:
  - it uses Makefiles and uses the system gcc instead of nacl-gcc.  We should probably integrate this more into scons or something.
  - it has a lot of duplicate cases (e.g., it uses 8 libraries when probably 3 or is enough, and has N global vars exported by each library when only a few of different sizes/alignments is enough).
