- We have to maintain chrome/nacl-gdb compatibility. In this particular case we can switch software single stepping off as soon as chrome version that needs it retires from stable. I think in our case that version is M22, but I'm not completely sure;

- Software single stepping is actually used on demand, in particular only to avoid breakpoints after sandboxing instructions that damage stack pointer. When stepping over other instructions, hardware single stepping is used;

- Software single stepping does not alter nacl-gdb user experience if user does not need breakpoints in the middle of sandboxing sequences as described above. In most cases, users will never notice if software single stepping is used or not;

- Code that enables software single stepping in nacl-gdb is very clean and simple (&lt;50 LOC).

The summary is: we definitely should turn software single stepping off when we know for sure it is not needed any more. Until that, we do not need to worry so much about it, as it does not complicate nacl-gdb and does not alter user experience.
