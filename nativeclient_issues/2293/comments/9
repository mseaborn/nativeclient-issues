"""
When certain criteria are met, an implementation is allowed to omit the copy/move construction of a class
object, even if the copy/move constructor and/or destructor for the object have side effects. In such cases,
 the implementation treats the source and target of the omitted copy/move operation as simply two different
  ways of referring to the same object, and the destruction of that object occurs at the later of the times
 when the two objects would have been destroyed without the optimization.123 This elision of copy/move
operations, called copy elision, is permitted in the following circumstances (which may be combined to
eliminate multiple copies):
&#8212; in a return statement in a function with a class return type, when the expression is the name of a
non-volatile automatic object (other than a function or catch-clause parameter) with the same cv-
unqualified type as the function return type, the copy/move operation can be omitted by constructing the automatic object directly in to the function's return value
""""
So it's legal, even with side effects. Both compilers are conformant, and the proxy is 'correct', if inefficient. We can file a bug against the NaCl proxy's resource tracker to make it avoid making an extra RPC call in this case. But I think it would not be high priority, since the Chrome IPC proxy resource tracker does not do the extra RPC in this case. Would you like me to write that bug?</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-10-03T16:11:52.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-10-03T16:11:52.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 9 by dmichael@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2293#c9" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2293/comments/full/9" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
