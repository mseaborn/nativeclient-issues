We always use our own front-end (pnacl-gcc) for this purpose. In other words, we always invoke llvm-gcc with -emit-llvm.

2) This is a feature. If we didn't explicitly check for the arm trusted toolchain's presence, then you'd get a cryptic compile error half-way into the toolchain build. The reason this check was added is because this kept happening to people, causing a lot of confusion.

3) Ivan, everything looks like a mess until you understand it. If you think turning this into a Makefile will simplify matters, then you are in terribly misinformed.

4) What does binutils have to do with switching to Clang?

You need to understand the build system better before you start making widescale changes. I understand exactly where you are coming from. When I first started working on PNaCl, one of the first things I did was refactor the build scripts. But I didn't start until I fully understood it, could replicate the existing behavior exactly, in addition to adding new features like incremental building and automated testing.

But I did this by building a new script from scratch, leaving the existing one in place.

If you really want to make a change, I suggest you do it this way. If you can write a system that is simpler and can function as a full replacement, you'll be in a good position to convince us to make the switch. But right now, this issue doesn't make sense, because your complaints are too vague, and I think part of your confusion comes from not understanding the build process well enough.
