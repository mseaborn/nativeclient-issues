That was not true even before Clang. 

1. llvm-gcc that outputs portable executable files and llvm-gcc that is used by translators are not required to live together. 

2. ARM trusted toolchain is also a different entity and don't need to be there.

3. Global variables are only necessary because it's a shell script.

With Clang, it's not true even more. See http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2306

For Clang portable bitcode SDK, the dependencies looks about the following:

A) LLVM depends on binutils
B) binutils depends on llvm-install (installs gold plugin into pkg/binutils)
C) libstdcpp/newlib/compiler-rt depends on the frontend (Clang) and driver

If the proposal with the bitcode linker would be accepted, the dependencies would be even easier:

A) libstdcpp/newlib/compiler-rt depends on the frontend (Clang) and driver

For GlibC the picture would be the same (with the only difference, that we would have a tool that generated link-time .pso for glibc and push them into a repo)

Also, I don't buy "Doing anything out of order is dangerous". It's only dangerous because of the implementation, because utman.sh think of actions instead of goals.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-09-28T00:15:58.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-09-28T00:15:58.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 13 by krasin@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2312#c13" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2312/comments/full/13" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
