The tone of this issue is not particularly productive and seems to attempt to place blame on the predecessors of the test plan, with the effect of generally lowering their moral and self-esteem.

A possible way to make this more productive would be to accept up-front that you are an equal member of the team and accept personal responsibility for improving the status quo, perhaps approaching it from a positive perspective (e.g. 'Wow, this test plan has improved quite a bit over the last several months, although it use still use a little work to refine the details...') instead of a negative one.

I understand that being a release sheriff can be frustrating, having been one myself.  I also noticed that the test plan was in need of improvement, and did my part to incrementally improve the quality (just look at the revision history).  However, I recommend other ways to take out your frustrations that don't tear down the team in the process.

Cheers,
