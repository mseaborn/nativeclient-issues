An alternative (or better, additional) approach is to warn people that the implementation is changing rapidly, and say that these instructions aren't guaranteed to work. We could add that if they don't work, please return in a {certain amount of time}, when things should have settled down a bit.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-06-16T20:21:12.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-06-16T20:21:12.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 6 by kathyw@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=531#c6" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/531/comments/full/6" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
