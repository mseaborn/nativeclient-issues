The problem is that we don't have a good integration test.  I would personally close this "bug" as "Won't be fixed".

I have updated the Chrome manual test plan with all the SDK bundled examples.  As Pepper2 come on line, there are trusted unit tests and we plan to have all those duplicated in untrusted code.

So, I guess the real issue is that we release versions of chromium when we should not.  Maintaining a table of working configs as suggested here is not sustainable.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-06-16T20:12:57.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-06-16T20:12:57.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 5 by dsprin...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=531#c5" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/531/comments/full/5" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
