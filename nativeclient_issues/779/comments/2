Yes, possibly, since the reporter says their system has plenty of
memory.  However, we are testing on 32-bit Windows XP -- I have tested
this myself -- so presumably it would be something in a non-standard
setup that reduces address space, such as an automatically loaded DLL.

Maybe it would be useful to have a tool to diagnose this, such as
something that lists memory mappings.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-08-03T21:20:19.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-08-03T21:20:19.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 2 by mseaborn@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=779#c2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/779/comments/full/2" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
