is that Makerules does this:

-include $(common-objpfx)sysd-rules

It is the "-" prefix that causes errors to be ignored.

The "-" prefix was there before I added make_sysd_rules.py and
(AFAICT) was not necessary.

However, make_sysd_rules.py has the following problem: It works if it
is run from the top-level source directory, but not from a
subdirectory.  But it will only get run from a subdirectory if
make_sysd_rules.py (or config.make or Makerules -- sysd-rules'
dependencies) is modified while make is running.

The "-" prefix is now acting as a workaround for such failures.

make_sysd_rules.py should ideally be fixed to work from a
subdirectory, but fixing this case is problematic because it will
rarely be tested because it is triggered in a race condition.
