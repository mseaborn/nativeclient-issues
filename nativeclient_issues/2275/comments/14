- Can you please put this under version control someplace? Or in a Wiki? If you'd like access to the NaCl repo for this purpose that sounds reasonable to me. However this would need to be done using a personal (not role) account.
- Including a side-by-side comparison with the ARM address space layout and sandbox rules might be useful for people who are familiar with that sandbox. Key differences could also be helpful in recognizing the interesting parts of both systems.
- Did you put any thought into a 64-bit sandbox? Perhaps it is the ILP32 requirement?
- Can you explain explicitly what is supposed to happen if a pointer wraps around below address zero?
- The document is structured around what is possible. This is one way to approach things, but I'd like to see:
  - a high-level list of what common MIPS ISA features are _not_ allowed. This will identify features we want to check with tests and in the validator implementation.
  - in this context specifically a clearer statement of what addressing modes exist and what are not allowed, and state explicitly that it applies to all loads/stores including stack references; what about target address calculations?
- Can you cite your preferred reference for current MIPS architecture? One detail I'd like to be able to confirm is that the 32-bit MIPS ISA always uses a delayed branch. Do I recall correctly that the 64-bit MIPS ISA does not use a delayed branch?
