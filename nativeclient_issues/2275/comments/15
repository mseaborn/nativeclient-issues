- Having the document in NaCl repository would be fine, if we can have an access to change it once it needs to be updated. If that is possible, let me know what would be a desirable placeholder (and provide me with some access to put it). Thanks.
- As of ARM/MIPS comparison, sure, we can add it to the document, though the similarities between the two seemed pretty obvious to us (this is why we have omitted the comparison).
- MIPS 64-bit support is of interest to us, but we have not spent enough time to discuss it much yet.
- Pointer can not wrap below address zero. It can not reach that low (i.e. high).
- We have a principle that "everything which is not allowed is forbidden". Having said this, I do understand what you mean, and while we implicitly list what action/modes we are preventing, sure we can list all the actions/patterns/instructions that we consider problematic. As of target address calculations, what concerns do you have?
- Our target architecture is MIPS32R2 instruction set; the reference for it is "MIPS32&#174; Architecture For Programmers Volume II: The MIPS32&#174; Instruction Set" and it is mentioned in the document.
- We are targeting MIPS platform which make use of branch delay slots. In some cases, such as 'branch likely' instructions, the instruction in the delay slot is not executed if the branch is not taken. On the other side, microMIPS instruction set (which we do not support for the time being) has branch instructions without delay slots.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-02-15T01:32:42.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-02-15T01:32:42.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 15 by mips3...@gmail.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2275#c15" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2275/comments/full/15" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
