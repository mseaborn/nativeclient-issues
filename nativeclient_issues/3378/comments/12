We do run it as part of the llvm-test-suite.  We also test a few of those under scons's tests/math/*.c.  None of the pexes have llvm intrinsic versions of those functions (e.g., if there was a transformation that converted C library calls to those).


Browsing the llvm/test/Transforms directory, I couldn't find any test that would suggest that C library calls to those functions could become intrinsics (right now).


Browsing the source, I only saw special handling in the backend (e.g, if you wanted to fuse a sin + cos call into a sincos call), and some special handling for the LoopVectorizer.


So, perhaps for now those are not a big priority.
