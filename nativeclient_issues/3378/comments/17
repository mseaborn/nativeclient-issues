I don't have an example off-hand that would abuse this (given that we ban asm and dyn code modifications), but it seems better for now to not include it in the whitelist.


It's currently used by the sandboxed llvm build.  This was done to:

(a) Choose the default commandline arguments for arm vs x86-32 vs x86-64.  Part of the commandline is baked into LLC so that the version of LLC is a bit more decoupled from the browser and the browser won't ask for flags like "-sfi-store" when we have changed the flag names around in LLC, or removed the flags from LLC to make them default.


(b) One way to have done (a) is to use if-defs, but that changes the bitcode.  Something more dynamic let's us save on the number of bitcode builds from 3 to 2 (one pexe with the arm backend, one pexe with the "x86" backend vs having split the two x86 builds).



To blacklist this intrinsic, we could

(1) disable ABI verification for llc.pexe (but maybe that is an interesting test case)...


(2) Change the way default arguments are supplied and chosen.  Perhaps the initialization RPC will tell llc which architecture to choose instead of using a builtin.

(3) As part of the build process run "opt -expand-builtin-nacl-arch", to split the x86 build into two, without building the whole thing twice.


There's probably other options... Eventually the way commandline flags are set up could be done better, but perhaps (3) will be least invasive for now?</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2013-06-03T20:31:54.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2013-06-03T20:31:54.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 17 by jvo...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3378#c17" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/3378/comments/full/17" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
