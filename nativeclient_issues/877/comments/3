boundary.  the last 32 bytes of the text region is reserved for a HLT sled.
 there were some recent changes to this code, though i thought it was just
to generate explicit warnings when this safety / paranoia property does not
hold.  it used to be the case that the linker script ensured that there's at
least 32-bytes available, but that went away, i think, sometime around when
we switched to gold.  (sehr might know more details.)

as to this bug -- the service runtime should definitely not segfault -- i
don't know.  i'm still trying to get back to the point where i can bulld any
NaCl code, let alone write new code or test.

sigh.
