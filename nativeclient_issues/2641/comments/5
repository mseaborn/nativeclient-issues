However, I tried a fresh build of the arm IRT from the NaCl repo using the following revs:

 "pnacl_toolchain_version": "7898"
 "chrome_rev": "125604"
 nacl rev 8027

and it worked okay.  I can do as many mouse events and keyboard events as I like.

I did a bit of diffing with the block of code you pasted above and most of the code is similar.

* register allocation, instruction scheduling are identical (they become totally different with the fprintfs)

However, a few of the stack offsets and one of the movw/movt constants is different in my version.  I'll try another build of tomorrow to double check.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-03-16T02:49:34.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-03-16T02:49:34.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 5 by jvo...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2641#c5" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2641/comments/full/5" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
