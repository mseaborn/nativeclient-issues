since this is a WebKit bug, a fix will have to be developed for the WebKit code and DEPS'd into chrome; no Native Client side code is needed.

currently http://codereview.chromium.org/8525004/ and http://codereview.chromium.org/8539029/ are viable workarounds for our bots.  once the WebKit bug is filed, we should update this to include a pointer to it, and we should mark this is fixed if/when the WebKit bug is fixed.  meanwhile, reducing priority since we don't think this is likely to affect users too much (it occurs very infrequently and is hard to reproduce; when it happens, most users will not distinguish this WebKit bug from network issues and will most likely just hit the reload button, and that load will likely succeed).  keeping this issue open for documentation purposes, in case the probability of occurrence suddenly spikes again and/or we need to inform others how to workaround the problem.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-11-15T22:02:17.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-11-15T22:02:17.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates>
