I discussed this with Brett and Darin, and they thought that the flags state was analogous to command line switches, and so should not be part of the profile, but rather the browser's local state, which is read before starting the threads.

They directed me to Miranda Callahan (NYC) and I got the following response:

"this is a change I agree with, yes -- we were actually just discussing
this very change last week.  I think it could be done quickly, but
cc-ing Nico, who implemented it, in case he knows of some hidden
issues.  If Nico can't think of anything, I can try to get a patch in
this weekend."</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-01-20T21:58:44.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-01-20T21:58:44.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 10 by bbu...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1322#c10" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1322/comments/full/10" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
