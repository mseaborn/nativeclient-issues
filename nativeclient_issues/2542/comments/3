_nl_load_locale opened the file via nacl-mounts, receiving a fake descriptor 3, tried to mmap() it. NACL_SYSCALL(mmap) returned 0, __mmap returned 0, which is _not_ equal to MAP_FAILED, boom.

Even before that moment there were 2 mmap() calls with 0 return values:

mmap 0xffffe82c, 2162688, 7, 131106, fd -1, 0 = 0
mmap 0xffffe8ac, 2162688, 7, 131106, fd -1, 0 = 0

This looks wrong - mmap is supposed to return -1 on error, and 0 is neither that, nor a valid mapping address. Looks like a bug?


Also, nacl-mounts should intercept mmap and filter it against the fake fd table. This is easily doable.


Without nacl-mount nothing happens. I'm not clear on this, but would adding locale files to manifest help, or is that hole closed after the initial link?</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-01-18T23:22:01.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-01-18T23:22:01.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 3 by eugeni.s...@gmail.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2542#c3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2542/comments/full/3" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
