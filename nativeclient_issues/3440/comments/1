We would have to duplicate the loading and parsing code, and then repeat this in the plugin. In the long term, we plan to remove the trusted NaCl plugin and so this problem will go away.

Changing the MIME type seems disruptive but perhaps the easiest solution.

Another possibility would be to let the plugin do the final determination. So we would remove the --enable-nacl check when creating the trusted NaCl plugin and add a PPB_NaCl_Private.IsNaClEnabled function so the plugin can test this after parsing the manifest. The downside is that we would lose the ability to show that the plugin was blocked on the page. Perhaps the NaCl plugin can exit and we can get a similar effect that way.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2013-05-20T23:56:21.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2013-05-20T23:56:21.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 1 by bbudge@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3440#c1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/3440/comments/full/1" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
