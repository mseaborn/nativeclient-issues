Mini-digression explaining that:
I mentally broadened that bug to include other NaClUITests, specifically, the one that tests the chrome sandbox from the perspective of NaCl. I.e., the commit turned that one NaClUITest on. However, I think it has since been turned off again. If I remember correctly, the reason was maybe some complication with passing along a command line option (--test-nacl-sandbox=X). Perhaps that complication can be worked around.
End-mini-digression.

Anyway, in terms of this bug, I am guessing that "WontFix" is appropriate, since the old "NaClUITest"s use checked in binaries, and have been turned off. Does that sound right?

+cc ncbray, who I am guessing knows the situation with NaClUITests.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-06-24T21:00:49.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-06-24T21:00:49.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates>
