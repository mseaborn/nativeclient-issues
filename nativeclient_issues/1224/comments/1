Sounds good to me.  The test is already disabled and the tracking bug for it is:
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=64973 .  Should I assign it to one of you?

I agree. Since we will be changing all the tests to work with the PPAPI version of the plugin in the nearest future, it won't be an issue if we disabled this flaky test for now.

Thanks, 
P.

Tony,

Polina may disagree, but I believe this is likely to be due to some changes in NaCl that are unrelated to Chrome.  I believe it would be fine to disable the test in Chrome and let us take a look at it.

Hi Mark,

I was wondering if you could help me fix a nacl regression I introduced.  The change I made is here:
  http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/72974
Passing ints through npapi now result in a double rather than an int.  This was done to match Safari, although it differs from Firefox.

This seems to have caused NaClUITest.SrpcBasicTest to start failing in Chromium.  This corresponds to native_client/tests/prebuilt/*/srpc_basic.html and the pass/return tests are now failing.  You seemed to have been the last person who touched this file.

For reference, some other chromium tests started to fail, but I fixed them here:
  http://codereview.chromium.org/5482002

I poked around a bit in the native client code, but I'm not sure where to make the fix.  I'm tracking the regression here:
