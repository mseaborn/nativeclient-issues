I managed to get my game code running at decent speed on Atom. I suspect this is because I re-wrote parts of my graphics code, and I eliminated some very heavy use of function pointers. I also eliminated some memory reads, but that seems a less likely reason.

I was experiencing far worse slowdown than the mentioned double runtime, too. Might have been closer to order-of-magnitude difference, although I never measured it.

So, do indirect function calls sound like something that would run particularly slow on NaCl on Atom? And if so, is there any possibility whatsoever to figure out a way to do them faster?
