1)
When libstdcpp is compiled with llvm-gcc,  the "single" threads model is selected. When compiled with Clang, the "posix" model is selected.

In fact, llvm-gcc is doing it wrong. We are compiling llvm-gcc without threads support, which means it can't actually produce multi-threaded C++ programs.

You can see this running llvm-gcc with "-v":

Using built-in specs.
Target: arm-none-linux-gnueabi
Thread model: single
gcc version 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build)

Whereas, clang -v reports:

clang version 3.0 (trunk 140173)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix

In fact, nacl-gcc for newlib reports:
Thread model: nacl

Which suggests we may to do something special to get this working with newlib's implementation of pthreads.

2)
libstdc++ thinks clang is an X86-64 compiler.

This is because Clang was compiled with multiple targets, and X86-64 is the default target (according to clang -v). This can be fixed in the pnacl-clang driver by specifying ---ccc-host-triple le32-unknown-nacl even when -v is given.

3)
libstdc++ does not compile under Clang without modifications. There is a template construction in libstdc++ which Clang considers illegal, and a few other bugs. For example, I encountered this bug:

http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=6454

There is an unofficial patch on the web which may fix this:
