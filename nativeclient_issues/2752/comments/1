The file jp2uc.c is small but guarded by _MB_CAPABLE. Maybe  there may be more such options.

The problem with the local stuff is that it is quite big - as we just found out.
Also most people don't need it, but still have to pay the price for translation, etc.
We might be better off offering a dedicated
local library as part of  nacl ports.
