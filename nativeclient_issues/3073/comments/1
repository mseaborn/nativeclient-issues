A minor point -- it probably should be in a different file from crtbegin?  I thought crtbegin was normally for the "__register_frame_info" bits.  Perhaps it could be in "libcrt_platform", which currently holds the setjmp+longjmp implementations.

Hmm and yeah we can't just do (2) and omit (1) because of translation caching.

Also, it's used for x86-32 if you have -mtls-use-call set in the translator commandline... that was added a while back, when we tested building the IRT with llvm but I don't think it's been used since.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-10-09T16:29:57.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-10-09T16:29:57.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 1 by jvo...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3073#c1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/3073/comments/full/1" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
