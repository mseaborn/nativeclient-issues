instructions (not necessarily easy) for people who want to build the plugin
directly and launch the plugin itself through Visual Studio and then use the
plugin to build their .nexes.  For that, see:
   http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/sdk/vsx-plugin/vsx-plugin-g
and

http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/sdk/vsx-plugin/vsx-plugin-g/creating-a-project

We are still investigating delivering this plugin (with an installer) for VS
developers to use (w/o the debugging parts) because it directly calls
nacl-g++/nacl-gcc
for each .cc/.cpp/.c file and then calls nacl-g++ for linking.

I've been creating an internal document -- it's pretty rough -- and decided
to be brave and make it more widely disseminated.
It's located at:

https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/nativeclient/sdk/vs-nacl-development

and documents how to use a Visual Studio 2008 Makefile project with Scons,
how to set custom build rules in Visual Studio 2008, and how to build and
use the plugin we've been developing (which requires Visual Studio 2008
professional and the Visual Studio 2008 SDK).

It also includes a link to the Ogre3D page that discusses using a Visual
Studio 2010 C# solution that you can build and use to convert other
solutions to use custom rules to build .nexes.
