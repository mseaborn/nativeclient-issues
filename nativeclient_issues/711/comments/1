The scene it crashes on is the first one using FBO's, and on my MacBook, which does not crash, all the FBO-based effects don't render correctly. I then tried to see if I could come up with a minimal test case using the tumbler sample to see if FBO rendering works in NaCl right now, and I couldn't get it to work, and got many crashes. In fact, simply adding these two lines

GLuint fboId;
glGenFramebuffers(1, &amp;fboId);

to the tumbler source code would always make it crash after a while. Are FBOs currently working in NaCl? Are there any samples or test cases of this to verify that it works? I'm pretty sure it worked for me at some previous point.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-07-22T11:07:23.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-07-22T11:07:23.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 1 by jonasech...@gmail.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=711#c1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/711/comments/full/1" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
