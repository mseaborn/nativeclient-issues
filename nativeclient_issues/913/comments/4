discussion. Let me suggest what we need with some requirements:

   - A NaCl module that uses Pepper should depend on only a single,
   self-contained DSO. Compare to chromium.dll
   - The Pepper DSO should expose a minimum API surface. It should not
   export a bunch of stuff that people might not want to use. It should tend
   not to introduce link-time symbol collisions
   - Developers should be able to choose what version of libc they would
   like to use, independent of libPepper.so
   - As much as possible, libPepper.so can coexist with any other library
   provided it doesn't try to export Pepper interfaces.

Hermetic Pepper would be desirable but I don't believe it has been
sufficiently analyzed yet to understand what is actually possible. That will
be the first task for whoever picks this up. Note that since M8 supports
static linking only this is not relevant for M8.
