This may be what is causing the problem.  The problem with zlib version information is fixed in zlib 1.2.4 and later.  Unfortunately, there is no easy way to get one of these packages for OpenSUSE.

The google-chrome rpm package has a dependency for zlib version 1, but does not explicitly call out a requirement for version 1.2.4 (or higher).

Also, the SDK tools need a 32-bit version of zlib, which is not installed in openSUSE 64-bit by default.  You'll need to install zlib-32bit manually, in addition to several other libraries.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-02-18T18:33:45.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-02-18T18:33:45.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 3 by mball@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1458#c3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1458/comments/full/3" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
