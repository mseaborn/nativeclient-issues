The remaining error probably indicates one of two things:

1. We can't find 2^37 bytes of contiguous virtual address space in the 2^47 byte process, which seems unlikely, or
2. OpenSUSE's memory management config is slightly different and we're trying to reserve the guard regions.  This would manifest as either 40+GiB of committed swap, or (in the more common cases where that isn't available) a failure to allocate.

Whether or not Fedora is officially supported, this seems like a potential source of fragility on Linux, and we should try to reproduce it (as time allows, of course).

This might also be a sign that we should shrink the 64-bit guard regions.  As Victor and I have both pointed out, we really only need 2GiB of negative guard, rather than the 40GiB we allocate today.  If this *does* turn out to be an address space fragmentation issue, this would reduce our footprint by nearly half.

Adding Bennett to double-check me, removinng SDK tag as it now appears unrelated.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-04-14T15:21:02.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-04-14T15:21:02.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates>
