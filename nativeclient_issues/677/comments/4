the impact, if we don't fix it, is that some ports to NaCl will require adding

  #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

and similar, before other header files that depend on them.  it's not hard to do, so i doubt that it would dramatically decrease the likelihood that programmers will port any piece of code, but it would be a nice thing to do for our (emergent?) community to save them the effort.

in the older, more unix-y style of includes -- include files export their dependencies, and that's why in man pages the code example often shows a certain order in the include directives -- and often &lt;sys/types.h&gt; would precede others, like &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;.  it's unclear whether the linux man page for mmap -- where sys/mman.h is mentioned -- is (or should be) the final word on whether sys/mman.h should be usable alone, though the man page from opengroup.org is consistent with the linux one.  whoever accepts this should create a TC test suite of simple one-liners like the example that mseaborn made, based on posix man pages' specifications of minimal include files for each posix function.  there is already SCons machinery for compile-time "death" tests (used for NACL_ARRAY_SIZE, etc) that could probably be re-used.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-10-29T18:41:08.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-10-29T18:41:08.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 4 by b...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=677#c4" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/677/comments/full/4" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
