After more thorough testing, you're right: I'm experiencing a bunch of possibly unrelated issues.  After seeing the nexe fail to load in our project, I tried a bunch of different NaCl applications similar to what we're working on (Battle for Wesnoth, AirMech, Bastion) and all failed to load completely -- but looking at the console output, there are different failure messages for each (our app shows no error messages at all, and the others show, respectively, "NaCL module load error: NaCl module load failed: Nexe crashed during startup", "GET https://rs.carbongames.com/startup?ua=Rook%3B11058%eBNaCl64 404 (Not Found)", and "NativeClient: NaCl module load failed: Validation failure. File violates Native Client safety rules.").

When our own project has progressed enough to know better whether this is something we've botched ourselves, if this is still happening, we'll file a separate issue.

Thanks again!</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-08-01T14:50:13.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-08-01T14:50:13.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 16 by will.jen...@demiurgestudios.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1390#c16" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1390/comments/full/16" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
