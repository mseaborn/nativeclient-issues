This has happened about 3 or 4 times.

This happened on the last run of small_tests I did, which gave:

Test /home/mseaborn/devel/nacl-trunk/src/native_client/scons-out/nacl-x86-64/test_results/egyptian_cotton_test.out took 117.063876 secs
ERROR: should have taken less than 100.000000 secs
RESULT: /home/mseaborn/devel/nacl-trunk/src/native_client/scons-out/nacl-x86-64/test_results/egyptian_cotton_test.out FAILED

On a couple of past instances of this, I switched to another console with Alt-F1 (this was very slow) and found "top" showed Firefox at the top of the list.  Doing "kill -STOP" on Firefox stopped the machine from thrashing, presumably just because this is reducing memory pressure and Firefox was using a lot of memory.

This machine has 4GB of RAM, a dual core CPU, and I was running small_tests with -j3.  I can try switching to -j1 in future.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-11-04T21:04:19.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-11-04T21:04:19.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 3 by mseaborn@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1129#c3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1129/comments/full/3" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
