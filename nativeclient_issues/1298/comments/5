There are several options for fixing:

- add "-T xxx" to gcc specs. The problem is when xxx does not exist:
  - in newlib toolchain - this can be fixed just by adding xxx to newlib
  - in pregcc - i.e. glibc configure runs pregcc -static and fails
    This can be fixed by an ugly define given to gcc build that only enables specs hack for glibc's full gcc :(
  - if-exists does not work - it can conditionally substitute xxx but not "-T xxx" :(

- make static and dynamic linker scripts to be one script
  Unfortunately there is no way to alter linker script depending on this (or at least I didn't found one) - this implies the script should do the same things in both cases. At the moment this does not work:
  - we need different load addresses for these cases
  - dynamic executable has more segments than sel_ldr allows

Not sure how I will proceed ...
