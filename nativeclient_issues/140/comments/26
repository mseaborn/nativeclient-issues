Windows: Partly fix potential vulnerability from mmap hole race condition

On Windows, we have to open holes in untrusted address space when
doing mmap()/munmap(), because Windows does not provide an
atomic-overmap operation, unlike Unix.

After this change, we suspend any untrusted threads while the holes
are open, in case another thread (including those outside our control,
such as from system libraries or injected DLLs) allocates pages into
this space.  This stops untrusted code from being able to hijack a
trusted thread by writing to such a page.

We use SuspendThread() to suspend untrusted threads, and also set a
flag to tell threads not to cross the trusted/untrusted boundary.

For the time being, I am leaving NaClAppThread's "state" field alone,
since it's not used.  I would be happy to unify it with
"suspend_state" later if there were a test for it.

Also, there is scope for unifying the
NaClUntrustedThreadsSuspend/Resume() calls with the assignments to
nap-&gt;vm_hole_may_exist, but this can be done later.

mmap() and munmap() are the only syscalls affected.  sysbrk() is
atomic because it just does VirtualProtect() behind the scenes to
commit/uncommit pages.

Note that NaClAppThread's "cv" condvar was unused before this change.

Note that this change does not stop asynchronous writes into untrusted
address space that are made by NaCl syscalls such as imc_recvmsg().
