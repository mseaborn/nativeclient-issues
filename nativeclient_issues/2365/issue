PNaCl client components are not packaged with chrome and are instead fetched from a webserver/listed in the NMF (see tests/pnacl_client_translator). However, the components are likely too large to be placed in the normal installer.

&lt;b&gt;- Why is this a problem?&lt;/b&gt;

Not easy to use the client side translator, send out updates to the translator, etc.

&lt;b&gt;- The proposed enhancement:&lt;/b&gt;

If we delay-install PNaCl with the chrome &amp;quot;component updater&amp;quot; [1] we won't have to add to the (upfront) chrome install size. This may also be a way to duplicate the x86 IRTs for PNaCl without increasing the (upfront) chrome installer size.

The downside is that the files won't necessarily be available on the platform right away (must wait for the component updater to run). Perhaps with the appropriate UI plus a mechanism to force-install PNaCl when it is first demanded, this would work.

For testing, we would need a local hookup so that it doesn't need to be &amp;quot;downloaded&amp;quot;. Perhaps this is as simple as having the test harness copy some files to the expected install location.

Naive impression of the necessary steps (not necessarily in order):

(1) Script the packaging of LLC, LD, LLI, libs, IRT into a CRX file.
  - The installer will unpack the CRX to a custom location.

(2) Have a script to upload these CRX files to a well known URL, and have a mechanism for bumping the CRX version when we want to make a new &amp;quot;release&amp;quot;.  We will need to talk to someone about which URL is best (or choose a different URL for now).
  - Note, the URL may be changed to pick only the files needed for the specific arch (vs downloading ARM components on an x86-64 device, etc.).
  - We need a way to store the CRX private key (gives us authority to update the CRX) [2].

(3) Make a component updater subclass for PNaCl in the chrome tree.

(4) Add some a way to opt into registering and testing this the component updater for chrome, so that not all chrome users will need to have it. E.g., add a flag in about:flags to chrome.

(5) Have pnacl_coordinator open files where the component updater unpacks the CRX instead of downloading them from the developer's server.
  - Need an IPC to open such files on the plugin's behalf in the browser process. See PPB_NACL_PRIVATE_INTERFACE?

(6) Do the same to open pnacl IRTs that were unpacked from the CRX. Also see PPB_NACL_PRIVATE_INTERFACE.


&lt;b&gt;- Exit criteria:&lt;/b&gt;

Using the PNaCl client-side components does not require extra NMF goo / uploading components to the developer's server.
