Since they are a standard produced by every compiler for Linux, we know for sure that they are completely valid in practice.

But 66 66 90 is not part of one of those sequences, it was just an artifact of lossage in our toolchains that nobody else ever did.  So I don't see a need to accept it.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-07-19T18:25:32.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-07-19T18:25:32.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 4 by mcgra...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2049#c4" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2049/comments/full/4" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
