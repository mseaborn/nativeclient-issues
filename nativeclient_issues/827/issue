to build nacl-glibc.  Ideally it should build nacl-glibc against
pre-gcc instead.

The reason it builds nacl-glibc against full-gcc is that I hit some
build failures when trying to use pre-gcc.  I'll have to check again
what they were, but because pre-gcc's install tree doesn't come with a
libnacl or libc, I suspect there were link failures at configure time.

Building against full-gcc rather than pre-gcc is not a big deal.  The
resulting nacl-glibc should be the same.  Fixing this would just be a
cleanup.

Currently building a glibc-based toolchain involves these steps:
 1) Build pre-gcc
 2a) Build nacl-newlib against pre-gcc
 2b) Build full-gcc against nacl-newlib
 3) Build nacl-glibc against pre-gcc or full-gcc
 4) Build full-gcc against nacl-glibc [not done yet]

The cleanup would mean we can drop steps 2a and 2b.  But, if we want
to build/test a newlib-based toolchain anyway, having steps 2a and 2b
is not a big deal.


I am raising this issue mainly because Egor and Victor keep
complaining about this. :-)

This issue should not be confused with issue 660 (making C++ work with
nacl-glibc), which is entirely independent and involves building
full-gcc against nacl-glibc (step 4 above).</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-08-26T10:58:52.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-08-18T10:28:49.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:status>Fixed</ns2:status><ns2:owner>
