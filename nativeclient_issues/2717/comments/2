We used to rely on ud2a/SIGILL to report errors (this had allowed us to generate less code than a call instruction), but we don't do this anymore.
The reason we intercept SIGSEGV (and SIGBUS on OS X) is because wild access violations (like null derefs or accesses to the protected shadow gap in the shadow memory) are quite often under AddressSanitizer, and we want the developers to have more information about those than it is usually included in the crash report.
It is questionable whether NaCl needs those signal handlers. It is probably safe to disable them. However doing this for NaCl should not require disabling the handlers for the entire Chrome (or any other program that embeds NaCl)</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-04-16T13:23:42.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-04-16T13:23:42.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 2 by gli...@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2717#c2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2717/comments/full/2" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
