The first invocation is producing a minidump file which I can read in WinDbg fine.

I think this is falling foul of the kludgy fix I put in for issue 2237 and the fact that issue 2414 still remains.  I think there is a difference between the debug and release/opt builds.  In the debug build, the SetUnhandledExceptionFilter() callback is called just once.  In the release build, it gets called a second time because the stack unwinding is succeeding as per issue 2414, but it's not written to work when called multiple times in the same thread.
