Deadlock happens if printf() is called from HTTP2's OpenJob which is fired and waited for in GetNode(). GetNode is called under kernelproxy lock, unlike Read(), which only holds a lock on the particular file handle.

Note that Creat() is also called under the kernelproxy lock. This means that blocking operations in either Creat() or GetNode() should be avoided. Alternatively, these calls should be made outside of the lock, and each FS should implement its own locking as needed.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-09-13T09:15:53.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-09-13T09:15:53.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 1 by euge...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2252#c1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2252/comments/full/1" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
