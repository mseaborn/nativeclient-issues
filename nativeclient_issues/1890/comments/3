If we wanted to run lots more of such tests with the IRT, we'd have to either change how they get linked, or link two versions of each test.

The biggest reason not to run all the miscellaneous tests with the IRT is that they are intended to be unit tests.  If we run them with the IRT, then they are no longer narrow unit tests, but each also a test of the IRT machinery.  Perhaps that argues for having a non-IRT and an IRT variant of each test in many cases.
