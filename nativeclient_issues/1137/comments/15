I don't think PNaCl cares about address space all that much, but as Cliff pointed out an application might care. Is it hard to support in the rest of our code base? It'd think at least a more restrictive address space size should be a no-op to support.

Which code would use "*(int *) (ptr &amp; ~0xc0000000)"? User, TCB, ...?

PNaCl doesn't ship nexes.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-11-14T17:08:19.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-11-14T17:08:19.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 15 by j...@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1137#c15" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1137/comments/full/15" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
