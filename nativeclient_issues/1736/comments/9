I while back (when I was NaCl sheriff) I added more detailed printf output so I could easily see what was happening on failures -- here's a line from the timefuncs_test:
  Error: Elapsed time too short! t_elapsed.tv_sec=0  t_suspend-&amp;gt;tv_sec=1  t_elapsed.tv_usec=940000  t_suspend-&amp;gt;tv_nsec=0 

But, I haven't finished the CL for 3 reasons:
   1) Working on a high priority debugger bug
   2) With other changes to the tests made recently, I wasn't seeing this be a frequent failure..but obvious it's still there.
   3) Concerned about the usefulness of the timefuncs_test calls to nanosleep, since some are a copy/paste of the nanosleep test.

Perhaps instead the timefuncs test (which uses the syscall interface) should be simplified to make sure that a call to nanosleep does in fact result in some measurable delay, rather than worrying about the exact value, since nanosleep already does that and has a slop value in there?
