Pure SDK users should not have to run runhooks because they should get the tarball from our site.  If they're using SVN or gclient they're not pure users and they can set their path, unless we want to change all of our scripts to use the registry hack.  I think path is definitely OK, so long as we have output on failure, stating that location of vcvarsall.bat needs to be in the path.
As a user who ran into this problem, the first thing I did was to check my path and get pissed when the script wasn't using it.  I'll be happy to check every other windows machine in Boulder an confirm that none of them have this key.
However, if you'd like, instead of reminding people to check their path, we can add instructions for users to edit their registries and check for missing keys that VS 9 doesn't add on windows 7 machines.  Then we can change all of our python scripts to use this mechanism.
We're all running google supplied configurations and none of us in Boulder have this registry key.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-01-12T21:51:40.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-01-12T21:51:40.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 8 by mli...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1313#c8" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1313/comments/full/8" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
