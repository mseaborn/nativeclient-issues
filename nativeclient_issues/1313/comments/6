Currently our SDK does not offer Visual Studio integration but it's planned - and it's bad user experience to ask for the path to Visual Studio if it can be found in registry.

I've developed the script on Google-supplied system and it works fine there. We should debug the problem on the machine where the script does not work as it should and see what went wrong. We can try to plug the problem in create_make_cmds.sh by making it use path specified by user, but this will only mean the problem will be resurrected on computers of SDK users - not a good plan.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-01-12T21:38:02.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-01-12T21:38:02.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 6 by k...@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1313#c6" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1313/comments/full/6" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
