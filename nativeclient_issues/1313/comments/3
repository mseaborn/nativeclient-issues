Whether it should or not doesn't really factor into it. Maybe there's yet another patch we can add to the build instructions (http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-windows) to make it show up?  Otherwise, I'd say we should change the script so it doesn't make assumptions about the windows registry providing useful information.  The conventions for all our python scripts is to assume that the user can set is own path to include the location of vcvarsall.bat.  There's no reason this should be different.  Maybe a tweak so that it extends the system path, rather than overriding it would be possible?</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-01-12T21:18:13.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-01-12T21:18:13.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 3 by mli...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1313#c3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/1313/comments/full/3" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
