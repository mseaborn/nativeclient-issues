For the SDK examples, we need 2D graphics (pi_generator) and Audio (sine_synth).
Tumbler is also in the SDK examples directory, but that is a 3D example and the assumption is that it will be ported later when 3D is ready.

pp_event.h - I think this might already be done (as part of ppp_instance);  it's just some structs/enums that need to be shuttled across SRPC, no actual proxied functions.
ppb_file_io.h (and related)?  This will eventually be needed for e.g. the photo editing example to really work (to save changes) and almost any real-world application, but may be too much for M8.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-10-06T21:44:03.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-10-06T21:44:03.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 4 by pol...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=920#c4" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/920/comments/full/4" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
