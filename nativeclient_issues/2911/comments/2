We just need to make sure the tests continue to be run on the bots.  They are currently being run in the "scons [arm] [small_tests medium_tests large_tests] [pic no_pexe ]" step (e.g. see http://build.chromium.org/p/tryserver.nacl/builders/nacl-arm_hw_opt_panda/builds/1110).

As you say, ARM does not have hardware support for single-stepping.  I don't think we are going to implement ARM single-stepping support in the debug stub.  I believe GDB has already has support for single-stepping on ARM without hardware support, so we can just use that.

This issue can be closed now.  However, the conditions under which the tests are currently run on the bots seem rather fragile.  We should probably address the TODO in tests/debug_stub/nacl.scons first before closing this:

  # TODO(mseaborn): Eliminate the TCP port binding by using a socketpair
  # instead and move this into small_tests + nonpexe_tests.  Adding this to
  # nonpexe_tests (which uses -j currently) will enable this test for
  # ARM.
