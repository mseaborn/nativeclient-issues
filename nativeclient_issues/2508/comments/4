Do you have more information about these incorrect x86 implementations that NativeClient is potentially vulnerable to? I'd be interested in seeing some documentation from the NativeClient team as to why you'd make a statement like that.

Using the wikipedia list of x86 manufacturers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_x86_manufacturers) we could come to the conclusion that there are currently three x86 manufacturers:

 - Intel "GenuineIntel"
 - AMD "AuthenticAMD"
 - VIA "CentaurHauls"

However, I still stand by my assertion that a vendor string is not a CPU feature and it does not belong in a feature check.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-01-18T19:49:41.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-01-18T19:49:41.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 4 by bjornstar</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2508#c4" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2508/comments/full/4" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
