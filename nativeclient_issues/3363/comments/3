having this function in the headers makes porting needlessly difficult.

Is it not true that there are many functions declared in the headers which are
not present without -lnosys?  I think we shoudl be consistent here.  Either all
the nosys functions should be included or none.  If you want to argue for none, then
we have a problem of how to inject these extra declarations into builds that do
link with nosys/nacl_io.  Perhaps some kind of macro which declares that nosys /
nacl_io is being used?

Personally I'd rather see a complete set of headers for posix functions and let the
link fail if the user forgets nacl_io/nosys on the link line.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2013-04-04T22:40:40.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2013-04-04T22:40:40.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 3 by sbc@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3363#c3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/3363/comments/full/3" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
