newlib does not have complete or compliant POSIX headers anyway, so don't fool yourself about how complete it will ever be.

As I said, I don't especially object to this.  But it seems questionable whether it's worthwhile to do it in an ad hoc, piecemeal way like this.  Perhaps you should instead undertake a thorough survey of what POSIXish functions are provided by nosys and/or nacl_io and whether/where they are declared in newlib headers.  Then we can become consistent in one fell swoop.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2013-04-04T22:45:27.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2013-04-04T22:45:27.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 4 by mcgra...@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3363#c4" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/3363/comments/full/4" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
