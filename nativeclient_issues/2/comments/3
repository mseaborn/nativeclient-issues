and French) I think forcing English developer support is a *bad* idea.

Hard-coded paths make everyone's life more difficult. You lose developers who should
be testing and enhancing, and alienate people. Think of all those great Estonian
hackers and cryptographers (no, I'm not kidding, there are some great people there)
who won't look at your source because their OS has spoken Estonian for years...

Also, you'll be finding those hard-coded English paths FOREVER. Been there and done
that; I speak from experience.

Rather than full i18n support, a small step might be to just have one config file
where all those pesky "C:\Windows" things can be configured. Just my $0.02 (CAD).</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2009-03-03T01:51:42.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2009-03-03T01:51:42.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 3 by andrew%fernandes.org@gtempaccount.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2#c3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2/comments/full/3" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
