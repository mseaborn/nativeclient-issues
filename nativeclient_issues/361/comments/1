waits for the nexe to load just times out, it turns out that in Developer &gt; 
JavaScript Console there's a nice error message:

Not allowed to load local resource:
 file:///pathspec...

so i think chrome is disallowing the resource load even before the plugin is 
instantiated.  i enabled NACL_PLUGIN_DEBUG environment variable and set the 
SRPC_PLUGIN_DEBUG preprocessor symbol in src/trusted/plugin/srpc/utility.h and 
there's no output on that page.  however, loading another test page w/ an unmodified 
nexe path generated plenty of output, so the debugging code is active and working 
fine.

i'm going to mark this as WontFix, since we cannot have any kind of alert popup if 
chrome won't even run our code.  (actually, it looks like 
src/trusted/plugin/srpc/plugin.cc Plugin::Load has code already to call 
PortablePluginInterface::Alert but, again, it's effectively dead code.)  since 
there's a message in the JavaScript console and developers are likely to be looking 
at that anyway, even though it's not an alert, i think it's good enough.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-03-19T06:13:50.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-03-19T06:13:50.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates>
