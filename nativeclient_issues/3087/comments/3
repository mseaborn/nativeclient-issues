			<ns0:name>mseaborn@chromium.org</ns0:name><ns0:uri>/u/mseaborn@chromium.org/</ns0:uri></ns0:author><ns0:content type="html">At the moment, we don't deploy the x86-64 sandbox on Mac in Chromium, so it's not officially supported.  Our policy has been that if we add a new feature, if it's easy to make it work on x86-64 Mac then we so do, but otherwise we don't put in the effort.  For example, NaCl's thread suspension tests should pass on x86-64 Mac, but NaCl's fault handling tests (based on Mach exception handling) don't.

On the buildbots, we run "run_hello_world_test" on x86-64 Mac, but no other tests (see native_client/buildbot/buildbot_standard.py).  There's no problem with unit test coverage as such -- we just don't run all of the tests.  We are just keeping the basics working.

To support x86-64 Mac fully, two things would need to be done:

 1) Make all the tests pass on x86-64 Mac.  e.g. If you run "./scons small_tests medium_tests large_tests platform=x86-64" you'll probably find a few tests that fail and need fixing.

 2) Enable all of the tests on x86-64 Mac on the NaCl buildbots/trybots.  Whether we want to do this depends on how much of a maintenance burden it is, and whether we're likely to be deploying the x86-64 sandbox on Mac soon.

As a middle ground, we could add more tests to our 64-bit Mac list in buildbot_standard.py.  We could add an FYI bot for x86-64 Mac.
