the kernel's loader, or sel_ldr?  the elf header of sel_ldr, which the kernel's 
loader sees, gets mapped right now to vaddr 0x70000000 -- is this what you want moved 
to an address that's lower than 0x40000000?  or are you referring to the elf header 
of the untrusted NaCl module?

we've been talking about various approaches to this, and if we used a new section 
then one potential result is that the space reserved is mapped by the kernel w/o 
MAP_NORESERVE -- if the kernel tries to ensure that there is enough ram / paging 
space for the entire untrusted address space, then it would be unacceptably resource 
intensive, since more than a few concurrent NaCl modules would likely exhaust all 
available paging space.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2010-02-24T19:12:09.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2010-02-24T19:12:09.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 6 by b...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=232#c6" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/232/comments/full/6" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
