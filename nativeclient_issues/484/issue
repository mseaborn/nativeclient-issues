http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/wiki/ModularBuildProposal

The existing tools/Makefile for building the NaCl x86 toolchain has some problems:

* It does not support incremental rebuilds.  e.g. If gcc changes, you'd want to rebuild gcc, 
newlib etc. without rebuilding binutils.  Similarly, when glibc is added to the toolchain 
build, I don't want to have to rebuild everything just to test the glibc build, but I do want 
to have glibc rebuilt when the compiler changes.

* Makefiles don't support abstraction very well, so tools/Makefile has some duplication for 
unpacking and patching tarballs, etc.

* Given the resulting toolchain install tree, it can be hard to determine which component each 
file comes from.  e.g. Does nacl64/include/pthread.h come from newlib or from nc_threads?

* tools/Makefile doesn't cover the packages in native_client_sdk, which have their own build 
scripts.

It would be nice if we could use a tool like JHBuild, which builds packages in a uniform way 
from an XML description, assuming packages use autotools or something similar.  However, NaCl's 
toolchain has a number of special cases that would need to be ironed out before we can reduce 
the build to a simple data description.
