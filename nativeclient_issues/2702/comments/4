Even in point.pexe (opt and unopt) there is only one definiton of _impure_ptr (as there should be?).  There are lots of loads/stores using _impure_ptr, but mostly in different functions.  There are occasionally a few loads/stores in the same function, but different basic blocks...

Anyway, there are a few duplicated constants in point.pexe, but they are constants that perhaps had their address taken.  I.e., they are not adorned with the "private unnamed_addr" attribute.

With 'grep " constant" point.opt.pexe.ll | cut -f 2 -d '=' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | less'

The top offenders are:

      1  private unnamed_addr constant [9 x i8] c"xml:lang\00", align 1
      1  private unnamed_addr constant [9 x i8] c"xsi:type\00", align 1
      1  private unnamed_addr constant { i32, i32, { i32, [4 x i8] } } { i32 1, i32 0, { i32, [4 x i8] } { i32 0, [4 x i8] undef } }, align 8

So it's not too bad, even if they didn't have their address taken, or had some other reason for not being merged. </ns0:content><ns0:updated>2012-10-01T16:18:05.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2012-10-01T16:18:05.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 4 by jvo...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2702#c4" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2702/comments/full/4" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
