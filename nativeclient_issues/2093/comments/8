In fact, the problem is not with tool names but with target names - properly named tools are automatically picked up by configure scripts when they are given the corresponding target.

I'm not sure about most developers, but guys who approach building stuff that uses gnu autotools (in fact, almost all linux packages) now have to hack configure scripts to support "nacl" and "nacl64" targets. With "i686-nacl" and "x86_64-nacl" these fixes are not needed. In fact, a significant part of hacking in naclports is about supporting these malformed target names "nacl" and "nacl64".

"nacl" and "nacl64" are bad target names because they do not give configure script any idea on the architecture. Imagine we release arm toolchain, how would you distinguish nacl-g++ that compiles for i686 and nacl-g++ that compiles for arm? Oh yes, when you are developing for one arch, you can simply specify which one to use. But when you have to compile for a bunch of archs, you'll appreciate when configure scripts set up things for you automatically.

I vote for not having old tool names in the SDK. If the primary problem is the presence of the old tool names in the toolchain, I can kill that quickly - but be ready to fix old scripts that refer to these names.
