  abort, strlen, malloc, free

For this purpose, the symbols are exported from the .pexe, marked EXPORT in the crt1.x linker script that participates in the pexe link.

We can solve this by not doing native linking with libgcc_eh, since in the first release we don't plan to support EH anyway. But the option to link libgcc_eh has to exist for EH-specific tests and compilation toolchains that don't care about PNaCl ABI stability and compile directly to .nexes

Simply removing libgcc_eh.a from the link doesn't work because the native crtbegin (pnacl/support/crtbegin.c) looks for __register_frame_info and __deregister_frame_info, which are found in libgcc_eh. So we need to come up with a way to have two build types working:

1. The production "stable" build in which the symbols are not exported and libgcc_eh either isn't linked or doesn't require them.
2. A build for tests and for the native "unstable" path in which libgcc_eh is linked, and these symbols are either exported from the .pexe or are provided differently.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2013-04-24T19:44:15.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2013-04-24T19:44:15.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 5 by eli...@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3069#c5" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/3069/comments/full/5" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
