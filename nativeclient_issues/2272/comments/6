In general, I think folks agree that it's worth fixing most warning nits.  That's why Chrome's warning level is as high as it is.  My point is that we shouldn't just assume that all warnings will be considered worth it.  I'm sure we can find a few debates on chromium-dev that might give you a taste of this.

Think about this like a coding style debate.  There isn't necessarily a single right answer, but standardization is important.  If we think that some of the warnings that we have that Chrome does not are important, then we can bring it up on chromium-dev, just like people do every now and again with coding style debates.  Sometimes people agree that the suggested change is good, sometimes consensus disagrees.  We should take them on a case by case basis.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-09-21T19:47:54.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-09-21T19:47:54.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 6 by erik...@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2272#c6" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/2272/comments/full/6" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
