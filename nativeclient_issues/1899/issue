&lt;b&gt;from outside the Native Client team. A good summary will include:]&lt;/b&gt;

Currently, the source files and corresponding libraries for the x86-32 and x86-64 validator are not well factored. Code that is only needed for x86-32 must be linked into the x86-64 validator, and code that is only needed for x86-64 validator must be linked into the x86-32 validator.

This issue is to clean (and separate) source files and libraries so that libraries that are common to both are in a separate directory, and are in separate libraries.

Code that is specific to just the x86-32 validator should be separated and be in separate libraries.

Code that is specific to just the x86-64 validator should be separated and be in separate libraries.

&lt;b&gt;- Where are we today?&lt;/b&gt;
[e.g. &amp;quot;Currently each platform uses a different address space size.&amp;quot;]

The source, and the corresponding libraries for the x86-32 and x86-64 validators is a mess.

&lt;b&gt;- Why is this a problem?&lt;/b&gt;
[e.g. &amp;quot;This can make portability complicated.&amp;quot;]

It is very hard to determine what source code implements the x86-32 validator, and what source code implements the x86-64 validator. This makes maintenance and updates much more complicated.

All code is in one of the following two directories:

native_client/src/trusted/validator_x86:
   Contains code used by all validators (including arm).
   Contains code used by all x86 validators
   Contains code specific to the x86-32 validator
   Contains code specific to the x86-64 validator
native_client/src/trusted/validator_arm
   Contains conde used by the x86-arm validator.

&lt;b&gt;- The proposed enhancement:&lt;/b&gt;
[e.g. &amp;quot;All platforms should move to 1GB untrusted space.&amp;quot;]

Separate code in source tree (and the corresponding libraries), to match use. That is, create and separate source into the following directories:

native_client/src/trusted/validator
    Source (and libraries) that is used by all validators (including arm).
native_client/src/trusted/valdator/x86
    Source (and libraries) that is used by all x86 validators.
native_client/src/trusted/validator/x86/32
    Source specific to the x86-32 validator.
native_client/src/trusted/validator/x86-64
    Source specific to the x86-64 validator
native_client/src/trusted/validator/arm
    Source specific to the arm validator

&lt;b&gt;- Exit criteria:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;[How do we know we're done?]&lt;/b&gt;
When source/libraries have been separated as stated above.

&lt;b&gt;- Anticipated impact:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;[for users as well as other parts of the system]&lt;/b&gt;
Make it clearer what is the (external) API to the validator, and what libraries are needed.
