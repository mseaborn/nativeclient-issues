Make LLC use default opt level when pnacl-driver is only used for linking.

This makes LLC have the same opt level as we had prior to rev 10455,
which should make the ARM IRT binary smaller. To make it
even smaller, we could use LTO, but that hasn't been
tested.  On the other hand, this had been tested with NaCl
prior to rev 10455 rolling in (and we typically test with
LLC at its default opt level anyway).

Details:

We have LLC use its default opt level when the driver
is only used as a linker + translator:
  pnacl-clang++ foo.bc -arch arm -o foo.arm.nexe -Wl,...

However, we don't actually detect if the driver is really
only used for linking, so cases like:
  "ditto"       foo.c      "ditto"
Will end up with no opt in the frontend, but opt in the backend.
Mixed compiling + linking + translation mode *could* be detected
by piping more state from the frontend to the backend, but that
case seems rare.

NOTE: When optimization is explicitly set, it is still piped all the
way through to LLC. E.g.,
  "ditto"   -O0 foo.bc   "ditto"
