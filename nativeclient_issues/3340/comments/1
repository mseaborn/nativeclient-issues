			<ns0:name>dschuff@chromium.org</ns0:name><ns0:uri>/u/dschuff@chromium.org/</ns0:uri></ns0:author><ns0:content type="html">There's a localmod in lib/Transforms/Utils/SimplifyLibCalls.cpp which prevents modification of the known library functions themselves, which is a different issue (the C library functions aren't usually visible to the optimizers). In this case it's probably the right thing to do to disable the libcall simplification after linking. In general we are just running the standard O2 passes, when we should maybe be using a different set of passes (IIRC opt has a flag called std-link-opts or some such). This would be along the lines of what I tried in https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1941 although we should think about exactly what we want our flags to be, and what should happen. Probably even before we have the external preview.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2013-03-13T19:55:09.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2013-03-13T19:55:09.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 1 by dschuff@chromium.org</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3340#c1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/3340/comments/full/1" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
