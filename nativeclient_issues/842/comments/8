* llc generates new calls to bitcode functions:
  This has been observed for  memset, etc. (see previous posts)
  This has been addressed by 6246065 by more or less forcing the memset function into the pexe and keeping it from being internalized.
  It seems we have to options here: requiring the memset, etc. be part of every pexe
  or resolving the deps via libgcc, i.e. moving memset into libgcc

* llc changes calls (somewhat unexpectedly). This has been observed for changes such as  sqrt -&gt;sqrtf and  other trigonometric functions (c.f. http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=847)
It is not clear whether this is really lcc's problem or an artifact of running "opt".
This can result in undefined symbols and has been addressed by 6246065 by more or less forcing all functions
that we think could be called  into the pexe and keeping it from being internalized.
Alternatives: force the optimization pass that changes  sqrt -&gt;sqrtf earlier when sqrtf is still visible.
Disable this optimization altogether as proposed in: http://codereview.chromium.org/3197006/

* native libraries that will be linked to with the pexe call functions in the pexe.
   This has been resolved by three pronged approach:
    * making the native libs hermetic, e.g. by adding local versions of abort/memset etc.  
    * CL 6246065
    * ld+gold + plugin

  Alternatives: there is good change that we will get rid of our native libs (libgcc/libgcc_eh) altogether.</ns0:content><ns0:updated>2011-03-23T15:42:58.000Z</ns0:updated><ns0:published>2011-03-23T15:42:58.000Z</ns0:published><ns2:updates /><ns0:title>Comment 8 by robe...@google.com</ns0:title><ns0:link href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=842#c8" rel="alternate" type="text/html" /><ns0:link href="https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/nativeclient/issues/842/comments/full/8" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" /></ns0:entry>
